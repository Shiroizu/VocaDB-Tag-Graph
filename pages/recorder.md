#Instruments

From Wikipedia:
>The recorder is a family of woodwind musical instruments in the group known as internal duct flutes: flutes with a whistle mouthpiece, also known as fipple flutes. A recorder can be distinguished from other duct flutes by the presence of a thumb-hole for the upper hand and seven finger-holes: three for the upper hand and four for the lower. It is the most prominent duct flute in the western classical tradition.

It's very commonly used in [subeana](https://vocadb.net/T/7526/subeana) songs, since they like to parody Niconico's error message and related iconic recorder tune. It's also fairly common in [children's music](https://vocadb.net/T/4704/childrens-music), as the recorder is a fairly simple instrument to learn the basics of.
