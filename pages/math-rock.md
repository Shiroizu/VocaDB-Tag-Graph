#Genres

Math rock is genre of indie rock that mixes post-hardcore, prog rock and minimal music.
> Math rock is characterized by complex, atypical rhythmic structures (including irregular stopping and starting), counterpoint, odd time signatures, angular melodies, and extended, often dissonant, chords. It bears similarities to post-rock.
