#Vocalists

Since the release of Synthesizer V Studio 1.5.0 (2021-12-23), all SynthV AI voicebanks can [natively sing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De4cnZkl5pQ) in English, Japanese and Mandarin Chinese, regardless of the language proficiency of the voice provider. In subsequent updates, the language options expanded to Cantonese Chinese and Spanish, and is currently confirmed to eventually include Korean and French support.
