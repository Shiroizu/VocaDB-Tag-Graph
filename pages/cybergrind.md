#Genres

Cybergrind is the combination of the standard conventions of Grindcore taken to an even more discordant and rapidfire extreme, with the added Electronic dimensions of computer generated noises and drum machines. Generated sounds are created through the use of programmed synthesizers or MIDI files. Cybergrind began in the US of the late 90s. Agoraphobic Nosebleed is its most well-known practitioner, though the style is a decidedly underground phenomenon.
