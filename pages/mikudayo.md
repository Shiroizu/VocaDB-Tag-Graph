#Animation

A human-size Nendoroid costume created by SEGA. She is derived from the VOCALOID2 character Hatsune Miku.

Mikudayo first appeared at Tokyo Game Show 2011 as a sales promotion character for the game Project Mirai. The overall design was based on Nendoroid Miku, but the details were rough and clumsy.

On September 24, 2012, SEGA, Good Smile company and Crypton jointly registered Mikudayo and she was added to the official fanmade characters of Crypton. And Nendoroid model was released in March 2013.
