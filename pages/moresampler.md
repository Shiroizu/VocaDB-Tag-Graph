#Vocalists

Moresampler is a custom resampler for UTAU developed by [Kanru Hua](https://vocadb.net/Ar/81963) that uses more recent concatenative synthesis technology. Development was superseded by the standalone commercial engine [Synthesizer V](https://vocadb.net/T/6745/synthesizer-v), but secondary distribution is still permitted.
