#Derivative

**MEIKO Black**, also referred to as **Red Meiko**, is an ANTILOID derivative of the VOCALOID [MEIKO](https://vocadb.net/Ar/176), from Crypton Future Media. She was originally created by Benzarro85 in January 2025.

TW:// NSFW mention/mentions of sexual intercourse.

MEIKO Black serves as Benzarro85's interpretation as to what he thinks an "ANTILOID Meiko" would be, being a sexier version of Meiko, rather than gothic. MEIKO Black is obsessed with alcohol, smoking, gambling and doing you-know-what. Her main aesthetic is 1950's based.
