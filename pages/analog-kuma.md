#Themes

> The icon in an online parody movement against Japanese private-public promoting campaign for the transition from analog to digital broadcasting, and the antithesis of a mascot character of that campaign called Chidejika (地デジカ, lit. Digital Deer).
In the first half of **2009**, those 2 mascots caused a strange sensation on the Japanese web.
(...)
People with humorous anger against NAB (National Association of Commercial Broadcasters in Japan) began to lionize "Analog Kuma", a Shift-JIS art character of "クマー" or "Pedobear" putting a Yagi-Uda antenna on its head, as the antithesis of Chidejika.
*[-Know Your Meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/analoguma)*

"アナロ熊" (Analog Kuma) derived from the character art of "クマー" (Kumaa), more notably in the form of [Shift_JIS art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_JIS_art).
The bear character originates from the popular textboard website 2channel in Japan, where it was called "クマー" (Kumaa).
One of the earliest 2ch threads with this ASCII was posted on **February 27th, 2003**.
It later became popular through the imageboard 4chan under the name of "Pedobear".
Pedobear had become associated with pedophilia as early as **February 2005** when it was defined on Urban Dictionary as a character used on specific hentai boards and on 4chan.
