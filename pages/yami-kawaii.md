>Yami Kawaii (病みかわいい) provokes two of the biggest taboo topics in Japan: depression and mental illness. The term is a portmanteau of the Japanese words for "sick" (病み) and "cute" (かわいい), and impresses with its combination of pastel colors and black. It particularly reflects serious issues in its motifs, and that is what makes it interesting for many.

The art is by [Milano](https://vocadb.net/Ar/77345). It depicts [v4 flower](https://vocadb.net/Ar/21165) surrounded by both cutesy (teddy bear, hair clips) and more disturbing imagery (medical iconography, blood, bandages).
