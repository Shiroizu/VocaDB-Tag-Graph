#Instruments

The xylophone is a mallet percussion instrument consisting of wooden bars arranged like a keyboard. Compared to the [marimba](https://vocadb.net/T/4977/marimba), the xylophone has smaller and thinner bars, brighter tone, and normally lacks resonator tubes. Also, the xylophone plays an octave higher than its notated pitch.
