#Vocalists

Realivox is a vocal synthesizer by [Realitone](https://vocadb.net/Ar/32630). It has two main versions: [Blue](https://vocadb.net/Ar/32631), which is a full English singing synthesis voicebank/program in-and-of-itself, and [Ladies](https://vocadb.net/T/9383/realivox---ladies), a group of feminine vocable voicebanks attached to the eponymous sub-engine.
