#Vocalists

Pink is an extraspectral color: it cannot be generated by light of a single wavelength.
Pink/Magenta is a primary color in the CMYK color model, a secondary color in the RGB color model and a tertiary color in the RYB color model.
Can be created by mixing [red](https://vocadb.net/T/8912/red) and [violet](https://vocadb.net/T/8916/purple).
