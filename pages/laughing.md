Laughter is a physical reaction consisting usually of rhythmical, often audible contractions of the diaphragm and other parts of the respiratory system. 
It is a response to certain external or internal stimuli. 
Laughter can arise from such activities as being tickled, or from humorous stories or thoughts. 
Most commonly, it is considered an auditory expression of a number of positive emotional states, such as joy, mirth, happiness, or relief.
