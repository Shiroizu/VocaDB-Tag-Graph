#Sources

This AI is capable of producing sounds similar to Hatsune Miku and other singers. 

If a song is tagged with this, it may end up **being deleted** due to [not being in-scope](https://wiki.vocadb.net/docs/other-guidelines/content-policy#songs).

Additionally this tag can be used for artist entries who have made “Prompt vocal” songs (that are still available). Editors should be careful when adding song entries by these artists.
