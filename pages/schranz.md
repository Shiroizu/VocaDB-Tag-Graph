#Genres

> **Schranz** is a hard, repetitive and faster (usually between 140 and 160 BPM) style of **electronic dance music**, more specifically **techno**. 
It is characterized by the frequent use of noises and machine-like sounds and by repetitive, distorted percussion loops and a mostly monotonous character. 
**Schranz** is therefore a variant of tool and loop **techno** and can be described as a precursor to **hard techno**.

> **Schranz** is a genre of music derived from European **hard techno** and **hard minimal**, especially in Germany (mainly Frankfurt). 
In Germany, it is more often called **hard techno** rather than **Schranz**.
