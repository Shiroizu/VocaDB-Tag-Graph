#Genres

> Future bass is described as having a focus on a hard bassline with detuned synthesizers mostly including sawtooth waves and square waves. The sound waves are often modulated using automation or low-frequency oscillation controlling the cutoff of an audio filter (typically a low pass or high pass filter) making the waveform sound louder or quieter. In addition, it is common to find the utilization of a sort of "twinkly" sounding gradual rise in pitch, including arpeggio chords, and vocoders. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_bass)

>Taking a lot of characteristics from trap and progressive house music, future bass is described as having a focus on a  supersaw bassline.The sound waves are often modulated using automation or low-frequency oscillation controlling the cutoff of an audio filter (typically a low- or high-pass filter) or the level of the wave to adjust the waveform's volume (to create a ‘wobble’). In addition, it is common to utilize a somewhat "twinkly"-sounding gradual rise in pitch during "risers" (pre-drop buildups of white noise), and arpeggio chords, vocal chops or vocoders. The drums consist of kicks and rapid-fire hi-hats that are taken from trap music.  - [Electronic Music Wiki](https://electronicmusic.fandom.com/wiki/Future_Bass)
