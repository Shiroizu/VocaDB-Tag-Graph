#Vocalists

Voicebanks with no specific gender, or whose genders are up for interpretation.

Note: This tag does usually not apply to characters who are canonically [nonbinary](https://vocadb.net/T/7677/nonbinary), as their genders are specified. If the gender is specified as "genderless", they are nonbinary, and thus not eligible for this tag.
