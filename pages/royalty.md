#Themes

Songs related to royalty (kings, queens, princesses, princes, etc.), nobles, or other forms of nobility.

This can apply to songs about characters who are royal in some way, (ex. [Daughter of Evil](https://vocadb.net/S/1590)), or simply think of themselves as/want to be seen as such (ex. [I Wanna Be a Princess!](https://vocadb.net/S/8973), [World is Mine](https://vocadb.net/S/1326)).
