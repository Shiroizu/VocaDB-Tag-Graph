#Composition

In music terms. sampling is the act of taking a portion or a "sample" of a recording, reusing it as an instrument or as a hook for a different song or recording. It is mostly prominent in EDM genres, Hip Hop and Vaporwave.

An example of sampling would be [a drum break from the song "Amen, Brother"](https://vocadb.net/T/18/amen-break) made by The Winstons, a frequently sampled song.
