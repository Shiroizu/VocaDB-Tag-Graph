#Genres

Electronic body music (EBM) is a music genre that combines elements of industrial music and electronic dance music. The term electronic body music was coined by Ralf HÃ¼tter of the German electronic band Kraftwerk in 1978. In 1980/1981, DAF from Germany used it to describe their danceable electronic punk sound. 
Typical EBM rhythms are based on 4/4 beats, mainly with some minor syncopation to suggest a rock music rhythm structure.
Samples, e.g. metal rod, machine and alert sounds, are often used to create a "factory ambiance". Other samples include political speeches and excerpts from science fiction movies. (From Wikipedia)
