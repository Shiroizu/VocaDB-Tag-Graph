#Series

Star Girl and the Illusion Paradise (星ノ少女ト幻奏楽土) is a series by Story Researcher (doujin group formed by cosMo and GAiA). The series is a sequel to [The Fantastic Garden](https://vocadb.net/T/6444/the-fantastic-garden) series.

The story occurs in a strange city known as Stella that grants the wishes of the girls who live there, erasing their sorrowful memories and reality. Though they get what they want, the question is if it will really make them happy, and how long will they try to run away from the truth. While this occurs, a mysterious and obscure character tries to make them all realize the harsh truth, generally with dreadful results, as the inhabitants usually can't cope with it.  - [Vocaloid Lyrics Wiki](https://vocaloidlyrics.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Star_Girl_and_The_Illusion_Paradise_Series)
