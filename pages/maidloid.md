#Vocalists

"MAIDLOID" and "KNIGHTROID" are two heavily related voicebank engines created by [StudioS](https://vocadb.net/Ar/93572). Unlike most synthesizers on this database, MAIDLOID and KNIGHTROID are not meant to replicate singing or speech through their synthesis; instead, the characters are designed to produce sexual sounds when used. 
MAIDLOID is directly attached to [Acme Iku](https://vocadb.net/Ar/8927) while KNIGHTROID is directly attached to [Princess Knight RIYONA](https://vocadb.net/Ar/69292), each of whom are the only bank for their respective version.
