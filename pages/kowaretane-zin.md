#Derivative

Kowaretane Zin is a FANLOID of VOCALOID [Kagamine Rin](https://vocadb.net/Ar/14). She was created by Joyokii in March 2012.
Zin, although controlling, tries her best to show a calmer and false yandere side, allowing others to believe she is kind while she is a closet sadist. She is protective of not only her brother Zen, but also other Kagamine derivatives.

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku
