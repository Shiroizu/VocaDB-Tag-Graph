Benzarro85's design for Lohan based on [teruko LOLA](https://vocadb.net/T/10085). Any piece of information not talking about his design is Benzarro85's own interpretation of Lohan, e.g. personality.
___
**Appearance**:

Lohan appears as a fairly tall, slender, dark-skinned man with dark purple hair and purple eyes. His outfit is derived from teruko LOLA, except it is altered to appear more masculine. Lohan wears a grey, short-sleeved shirt underneath a black tank top, with the right strap appearing to be loose by appearing on the right arm. He wears long, black trousers and black and grey shoes.
___
**Personality**:

Lohan is quiet, reserved and is a bit reclusive. He enjoys most of his time alone or hanging out with Lola, his original VOCALOID self. He is dismissive of Leona/Leanne's platonic gestures, and is irritated by any other genderswapped VOCALOID, male or female. Although he shows that he is bothered by the simplest presences of Leona/Leanne, he has shown to care for her somewhat, even if he doesn't wish for anything to happen in return.

Unlike Leona/Leanne, Lohan talks to Wiriam, only occasionally. Wiriam doesn't understand why Lohan acts the way he does, while Lohan doesn't understand why Wiriam has to "get in his business".
