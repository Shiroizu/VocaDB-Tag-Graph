#Copyrights

Zenless Zone Zero is an urban fantasy action role-playing game with roguelike mechanics. The player assumes the role of a Proxy, a character who helps others explore the hostile alternate dimensions called Hollows. As they advance, the Proxy will recruit new members to their party as they continue to fight the Ethereal and other enemies. By combining the abilities of different members, players can deploy greater damage and combos onto enemies.
