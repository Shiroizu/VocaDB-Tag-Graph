#Vocalists

For voicebanks supporting E.V.E.C. (“Enhanced Vocal Expression Control”) and for songs that feature the usage of E.V.E.C. Songs that use any one of the features, all, or a combination of more than one can be tagged with this.
The image here showcases [Luka V4X](http://vocadb.net/Ar/18748)'s E.V.E.C. capabilities.

**E.V.E.C.** is a feature designed for use in Piapro Studio, though it can be used outside of it. It is supported by all of Crypton Future Media's Japanese VOCALOID4 voicebanks in the CV (Character Vocal) series. Many of these voicebanks only have Voice Release and Pronunciation Extension, and thus do not support Voice Color and will not be tagged to distinguish them from voicebanks that support all three of E.V.E.C's features. E.V.E.C. is not a sample-based system; instead, it acts as a set of presets for the voice.

**Voice Color**, one of the features of E.V.E.C., allows control over the overall tone and expression of the voice ([Vocaloid Wiki](http://vocaloid.wikia.com/wiki/E.V.E.C.)). (On VocaDB, E.V.E.C. Voice Colors are not tracked as individual artist entries because they're not separate voicebanks.)

**Voice Release** is another feature that adds a breath to the end of a note or sequence.

The third feature of E.V.E.C. is the **Consonant/Pronunciation Extension Function**. This will vary depending on the voicebank.
