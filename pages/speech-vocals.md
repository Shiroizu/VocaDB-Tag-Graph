#Vocalists

For songs which contain talking (speech) as vocals by a voicebank such as Vocaloid or UTAU. Generally Vocaloid and UTAU are meant for singing, so special care must be taken to make these voicebanks talk normally. This also includes talking by [voicebanks designed for talking](http://vocadb.net/T/6257/talking-voicebank).
