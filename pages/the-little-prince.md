> _The Little Prince_ (French: Le Petit Prince) is a novella written and illustrated by French aristocrat, writer, and military pilot Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. The story follows a young prince who visits various planets, including Earth, and addresses themes of loneliness, friendship, love, and loss. Despite its style as a children's book, The Little Prince makes observations about life, adults, and human nature. _(Wikipedia)_
