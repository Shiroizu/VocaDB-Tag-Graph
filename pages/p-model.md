#Copyrights

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-Model):
>P-Model was a Japanese electronic rock band started in 1979 by members of the defunct progressive rock band Mandrake. The band has experienced many lineup revisions over the years but frontman Susumu Hirasawa was always at the helm of operations. P-Model officially disbanded in 2000, although many of its members continue to release solo albums and collaborate with each other on different projects.
> Hirasawa has since released work under the name "Kaku P-Model" (核P-Model, lit. 'nucleus of P-Model'), effectively a solo revival of the band.
