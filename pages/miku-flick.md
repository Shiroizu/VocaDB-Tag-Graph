___

> Miku Flick (ミクフリック) was a 2012 rhythm game created by Sega and Crypton Future Media for the iOS operating system for iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch.
The game was a spin-off of the Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA series of Vocaloid rhythm games and was released in Japan on March 9, 2012 and internationally on April 9, 2012.
Like the original the game primarily makes use of Vocaloids, a series of singing synthesizer software, and the songs created using these vocaloids most notably the virtual-diva Vocaloid Hatsune Miku.
Miku Flick was the first game in the Project Diva series to ever be released outside Japan in English.

> A sequel to the game, named Miku Flick/02 was released on August 10, 2012.
On September 29, 2017, the game ended its service and was removed from the App Store, with the official website stating "various circumstances beyond our control" as the reason.
