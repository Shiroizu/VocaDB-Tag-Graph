#Genres

Noisecore is a derivation of Hardcore Punk. The songs are usually short blasts of noise, accompanied by screamed, growled, or shouted vocals. While there is some instrumental variation (some groups use drum machines, others use completely non-musical noise sources), noisecore acts tend to use a guitar and/or bass guitar.

Earlier releases tagged as "noisecore" tend to be a raw, chaotic, and lo-fi form of hardcore; artists in this style include Tranquilizer, Kuolema, and Brigada do Ódio. Napalm Death's "You Suffer" is generally considered the blueprint for most later noisecore, being approximately one second long. Typical noisecore releases (whether singles or LPs) can contain forty or more songs, with some releases claiming to contain thousands of tracks.

Lyrical content varies from highly political (Seven Minutes of Nausea, Fear of God) to the gross/offensive (later Anal Cunt, Gore Beyond Necropsy) to the absurd/surreal (Sore Throat, Minch); some acts (early Anal Cunt, Genital Masticator, The Gerogerigegege) use wordless vocal sounds. More recent acts include Kusari Gama Kill, Beip, Gorgonized Dorks and Nihilist Commando.

Note that "Noisecore" is sometimes used as an interchangable term with Mathcore and/or Metalcore by the press. It is rarely if ever used by these bands to describe themselves. "Noisecore" is also sometimes used to refer to Noise Rock with hardcore influences.
