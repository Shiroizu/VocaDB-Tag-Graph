#Lyrics

"Nonsensical lyrics" refers to songs in an identifiable language where the words have been arranged in such a way to be meaningless. [MARETU's](https://vocadb.net/Ar/1665) ["Tool"](https://vocadb.net/S/213374) is a good example: the song is predominantly in English, but the words are placed in such a way so as to convey no identifiable meaning.
