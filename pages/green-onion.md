Songs related to negis (ネギ, Japanese green onions).

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allium_fistulosum):

>Allium fistulosum, the Welsh onion, also commonly called bunching onion, long green onion, Japanese bunching onion, and spring onion, is a species of perennial plant.

>The species is very similar in taste and odor to the related common onion, Allium cepa, and hybrids between the two (tree onions) exist. *A. fistulosum*, however, does not develop bulbs, and possesses hollow leaves (fistulosum means "hollow") and scapes. Larger varieties of the *A. fistulosum* resemble the leek, such as the Japanese negi, whilst smaller varieties resemble chives. *A. fistulosum* can multiply by forming perennial evergreen clumps. It is also grown in a bunch as an ornamental plant.
