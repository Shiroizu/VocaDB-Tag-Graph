#Genres

Nu metalcore (sometimes referred to as nu metal revival or new nu metal) is the fusion genre of nu metal and metalcore that began in the 2000s and gained popularity in the 2010s. Some of the notable groups have also taken influence from R&B, pop, post-hardcore, and deathcore. The fusion is characterized by typical metalcore vocals and instrumentation often accompanied by down-tuned guitars, heavy bass, rapping, spoken word, soulful singing, funk samples, or turntablism.
