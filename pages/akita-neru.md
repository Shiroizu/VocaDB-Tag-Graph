#Derivative

A Vocaloid derivative who was originally created as a personification of early anti-Vocaloid trolls, jokingly interpreted as being tsundere for Miku. After the controversy died down, she remained popular as a tsundere character. She generally utilizes the voice of Hatsune Miku or Kagamine Rin (sometimes altered/pitched).
On April 1, 2008, Crypton adopted Neru as an official derivative character of Miku.

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
