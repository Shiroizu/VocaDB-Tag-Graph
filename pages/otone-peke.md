#Derivative

Peke's creation was inspired by a mistake Benine Rio made in the Vocaloid2 engine in 2008. While they were using it, out of curiosity they set every voice configuration as high/low as it could go, which resulted in the voicebank being completely silent. This inspired Rio to create a sort of "subspecies" of Vocaloid called Otone Peke, motivated by that failure that made voicebanks completely silent.

She received a boost in popularity in the overseas community in 2019 when a user on YouTube, Mellun, created [a Talkloid video featuring Peke](https://vocadb.net/S/240159). The video was about Len Kagamine, Rin Kagamine, and Piko Utatane attempting to find Otone Peke a voice. This motivated many fans to attempt to "give Peke a voice".

According to her official site, Peke is described as a cheerful and optimistic girl. She always carries around a notebook to communicate with others.
