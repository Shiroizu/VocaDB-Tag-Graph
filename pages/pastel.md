**This is a theme color tag! These tags are meant to denote videos or characters with a distinctive focal color, or songs *about* said color. Not everything needs to be tagged with these.**

Pastel colours are soft, pale, unsaturated; they're often used to create a cutesy-girly aesthetic that's soothing on the eyes. Note that despite (or, more accurately, *because of*) their unassuming demeanour, pastels are sometimes utilized in surprisingly [dark](https://vocadb.net/T/2957/dark) songs, often to create a sense of dissonance.

This tag may be used for:
* characters that utilize a pastel palette
* songs, videos, and albums that utilize a pastel palette
* artists that frequently utilize a pastel palette
