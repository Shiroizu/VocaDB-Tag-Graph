From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C5%8Dkai):
> Youkai are a class of supernatural monsters, spirits, and demons in Japanese folklore.
Youkai range diversely from the malevolent to the mischievous, or occasionally bring good fortune to those who encounter them.
Youkai often possess animal features (such as the kappa, which looks similar to a turtle, or the tengu which has wings), yet others appear mostly human. Some youkai look like inanimate objects (such as tsukumogami), while others have no discernible shape.
Youkai usually have spiritual or supernatural abilities, with shapeshifting being the most common.
Japanese folklorists and historians explain youkai as personifications of "supernatural or unaccountable phenomena to their informants".
