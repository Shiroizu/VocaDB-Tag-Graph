Imabikisou is a visual novel developed by Chunsoft for the PlayStation 3. It is the first visual novel to be released on a seventh generation console. It was later released for the Nintendo Wii under the title Imabikisou: Kaimei-hen with additional content. The game imagery consists mostly of static or animated photographs, though live-action clips are scattered throughout.
