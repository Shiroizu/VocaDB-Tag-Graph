#Derivative

Xiao Meiye is a genderswap based on [Xiao Meihua](https://vocadb.net/Ar/44796). He is also listed as one of the alternative mascots for [Miyo](https://vocadb.net/Ar/136863)'s DiffSinger voicebank due to Meihua and Miyo sharing the voice, though is not treated as a priority.

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
