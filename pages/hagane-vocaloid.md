#Derivative

The Hagane, also known as typeH, are a group whose image and songs are based around the heavy metal genre of music, particularly death metal and Nu-metal. They are often heard using the same voice setup as the official Vocaloids but seldom use audio distortion to push their vocal ranges to extremes to achieve a growling effect. Most Hagane songs rely on double bass and blast beat drum techniques along with heavier tuned guitars and bass to give that "down" effect usually used in metal today to achieve quality 'breakdowns'. Voice configurations are still being made for the members.

The name of the title and the characters was chosen by combining Kou (鋼, steel), Ne (音, sound) thus meaning "sound of steel."
(...)
The Hagane Vocaloids exist as two different variants. The first being by Hansi, the original artist of the Hagane Vocaloids, who only has designs for Miku, Rin, Len, and much later Luka; they are known as the 'H-Side'. For Momopanda's version they are derived from the official Crypton Vocaloids, making all members of the group present, they are known as the 'M-Side'.

Due to the groups creation being organized before Megurine Luka's release, this contributed to her late arrival from both artists. And only Momopanda is the creator of additional Hagane types derived from the official Internet Co.,Ltd characters Gakupo and Gumi.

Both artist are in contact and aware of the work their respective counterpart's work. They in fact have collaborated in some projects together and co-own the Hagane website HMVerses69.
