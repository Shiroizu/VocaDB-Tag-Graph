#Themes

> _Clover_, also called _trefoil_, is a small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plant, typically growing up to 30 centimetres (12 in) tall.
> _Clovers_ occasionally have four (or more) leaflets, instead of the usual three. These four-leaf clovers, like other rarities, are considered lucky.
