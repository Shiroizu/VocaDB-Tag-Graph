From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario):
>**Super Mario** (also known as **Super Mario Bros.** and **Mario**) is a platform game series created by **Nintendo** starring their mascot, **Mario**. The **Super Mario** games are set primarily in the fictional Mushroom Kingdom, typically with Mario as the main player character. He is usually joined by his brother, **Luigi**, and often other members of the Mario cast. As platform games, they involve the player character running and jumping across platforms and atop enemies in themed levels. The games have simple plots, typically with Mario and Luigi rescuing the kidnapped **Princess Peach** from the primary antagonist, **Bowser**.
