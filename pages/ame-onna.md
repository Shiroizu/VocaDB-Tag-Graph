#Themes

From Wikipedia:
> _Ame-onna_ ("rain woman") is a Japanese yōkai thought to call forth rain, illustrated in Toriyama Sekien's Konjaku Hyakki Shūi as a woman standing in the rain and licking her hand.
> In modern usage in Japan, "ame-onna" (or the male equivalent "ame-otoko") refers to an unlucky person that seems to be jinxed to have the rain follow them wherever they may go, thus gaining a reputation for ruining special events such as weddings or sporting events.
