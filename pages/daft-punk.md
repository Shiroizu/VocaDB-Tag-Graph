> Daft Punk were a French electronic music duo formed in 1993 in Paris by Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter.
Widely regarded as one of the most influential acts in dance music history, they achieved popularity in the late 1990s as part of the French house movement.
They garnered critical acclaim and commercial success in the years following, combining elements of house music with funk, techno, disco, hip hop, indie rock and pop.
They announced their split in 2021.
