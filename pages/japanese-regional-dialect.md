#Languages

> The dialects of the Japanese language fall into two primary clades, **Eastern (including Tokyo)** and **Western (including Kyoto)**, with the dialects of **Kyushu** and **Hachijō** Island often distinguished as additional branches, the latter perhaps the most divergent of all.
The **Ryukyuan** languages of **Okinawa** Prefecture and the southern islands of **Kagoshima** Prefecture form a separate branch of the **Japonic** family, and are not Japanese dialects, although they are sometimes referred to as such.
-Wikipedia

**- Kyūshū:**
- Kagoshima
- Hichiku
