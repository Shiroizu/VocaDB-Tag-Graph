#Sources

This tag is for vocal synth songs that were **made for or featured in** a video game. These can be originals, remixes, covers, or anything else, as long as they were *directly* used in a game.

For covers not in directly in an OST, but instead covering something *from* an OST, please use the [video game song cover](https://vocadb.net/T/455) tag instead.
