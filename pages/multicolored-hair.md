#Vocalists

This tag is for characters that have multiple colours in their hair. The hair could be gradiated (a la [Kokone](https://vocadb.net/Ar/16545)), have streaks ([v Flower](https://vocadb.net/Ar/21165)), be split between two colours right down the middle ([Charoemon](https://vocadb.net/Ar/25604)), or be multicoloured in a completely separate way.

[Illustration](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/55462767) by [三國](https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/1645492). It depicts [galaco NEO](https://vocadb.net/Ar/26988), who has both a gradient hair colour (going from a lighter brown to a darker brown), and three streaks (one pink, one blue, and one yellow).
