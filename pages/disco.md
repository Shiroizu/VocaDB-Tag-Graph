#Genres

The disco genre emerged in the early 1970s that is influenced by funk and Philly soul music.
>The disco sound is typified by "four-on-the-floor" beats, syncopated basslines, and string sections, horns, electric piano, synthesizers, and electric rhythm guitars. Lead guitar features less frequently in disco than in rock. (from Wikipedia)
