#Themes

Entries that imitate Kanaria's style. Are usually digital rock and/or gothic rock and themed around some sort of royalty. Lyrics often use some English phrases, sometimes broken English, much like Kanaria's own songs. Additionally, these songs (which are Japanese) are often sung by English voicebanks.

N.B.:

songs by Kanaria (including covers/arrangements of his works) do not count as Kanaria-style;
not every song by a producer tagged with "Kanaria-style" should also be tagged -- only those that fit the description above.
