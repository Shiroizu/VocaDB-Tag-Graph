#Themes

When a song has fantasy elements, and/or has a creepy or 'insane' theme. Can overlap with '[horror](https://vocadb.net/T/195/horror)' or '[ero guro](https://vocadb.net/T/4753/ero-guro)'.

Insane fantasy also deals with content such as:

* Beings like monsters, ghosts, demons, gods, and other fantasy creatures, especially as used in occult horror.
* Fairy tale-like themes, in combination with 'creepy' themes.
* [Yandere](https://vocadb.net/T/489/yandere) songs, or similar violent character tropes.
* Songs meant to evoke fear or uneasiness in its listeners, similar to horror.
* Violence, gore, abuse, death/murder, psychological horror, inner conflict (especially when used for horror), and other related subjects.

This can apply to songs revolving around these themes, albums with these songs, and artists making songs with these themes.
