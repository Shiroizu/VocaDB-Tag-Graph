#Derivative

Dolly is the VOYAKILOID derivative of the VOCALOID [Chika](https://vocadb.net/Ar/25148), created by Internet Co. Ltd. She was created by Benzarro85 in September 2023.

Dolly is Benzarro85's interpretation of what a VOYAKILOID Chika would be. A VOYAKILOID Chika already exists as Kyoko.

Her voice is lower than fellow Chika derivative [Shin Sekai](https://vocadb.net/T/10682/shin-sekai), like low and grumbly/grouchy.

She is Benzarro85's first VOYAKILOID derivative.
