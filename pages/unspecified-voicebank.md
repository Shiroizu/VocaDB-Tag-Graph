#Editor_notes

This is specifically for cases where a base voicebank is credited, but the vocalist sounds like a non-base version. For instance, the song is credited to "初音ミク", but the artist actually used [Miku v4 Solid](https://vocadb.net/Ar/50235) cross-synthed with [v4 Dark](https://vocadb.net/Ar/50233), prompting this tag. This tag can be removed and replaced by the [unconfirmed vocalists](https://vocadb.net/T/6416/unconfirmed-vocalists) tag if a user can reasonably infer or identify which particular banks were used.

This is not to be confused with ["unspecified voicebank version"](http://vocadb.net/T/4862/unspecified-voicebank-version) which is for when a specific voicebank is known, but not which version (i.e. it is known Miku's Dark voicebank is used, but not which generation of VOCALOID the voicebank is).
