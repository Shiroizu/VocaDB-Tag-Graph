Songs related to mirrors or songs related to reflects

From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror)
>Mirrors are objects that reflect the things in front of them. As such, they're frequently utilized in fiction, often to showcase situations where the reflection is *not* a one-to-one image of that in front of it.
