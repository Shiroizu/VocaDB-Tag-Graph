#Genres

Dark psychedelic trance is the heavier end of the psychedelic trance spectrum with BPMs from about 148 and over. Characterized of having obscure, deep and more eschatological background that leads into profound meditation of death, night and transcendence, often with dismal sounds and heavy basslines.
