#Derivative

A fake Vocaloid made with cross-synthesis.
According to Planty, Stella's Core voicebank was made via XSY with Kokone and Rana. Stella's Sun voicebank was made via XSY with Merli and MEIKO. He has not yet given details on the Moon voicebank, but it was made with VIBE, bplats and unknown utau. -Fanloid wiki

In January 2015, Stella was announced as an upcoming Japanese VOCALOID being produced by the team PL Tech, for the nonprofit organisation Americans for the Arts. It was stated that Stella was private because the expenses needed to release her as a commercial Vocaloid were too great. She had three 'voicebanks' listed, known as "core", "sun" and "moon".
Over time suspicion grew among fans that Stella might be a hoax, with a turning point in public view occurring when a discrepancy was spotted in one of her demos, revealing the videos to be doctored. On January 19, Planty finally confessed that Stella was fake, leading to large amounts of vitriol within the community. Within hours of the confession it was revealed Stella was created using XSY modding. Consequently, any work that had been produced using her was illegal. Though two of the vocals were initially revealed to be created using XSY, the third Planty stated was made using a VOCALOID Dev kit. -Vocaloid wiki

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
