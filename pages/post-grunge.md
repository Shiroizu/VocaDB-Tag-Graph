#Genres

Post-grunge is a derivative of grunge that has a less abrasive or intense tone than traditional grunge. Originally, the term was used almost pejoratively to label mid-1990s rock bands that emulated the original sound of grunge combined with a more radio-friendly songwriting style. Their music often incorporate pop melodies, occasionally angst-filled lyrics. Sometimes will have both an acoustic guitar and an electric guitar play simultaneously.
