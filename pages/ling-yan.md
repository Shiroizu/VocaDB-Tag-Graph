#Derivative

For songs or albums that explicitly define the use of the derivative, Ling Yan (陵炎).

Ling Yan is a derivative made with the cross-synthesis (XSY) mixing of [Yuezheng Ling](http://vocadb.net/Ar/23972) and [YANHE](http://vocadb.net/Ar/10025). He does *not* have his own voicebank.

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
