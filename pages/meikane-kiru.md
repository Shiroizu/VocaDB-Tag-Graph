#Derivative

Kiru Meikane is a fanmade designed for fanfictional purposes and is based on Hatsune Miku and also, in her storyline, Miku's classmate. Kiru, as a Vocaloid, is unique that she must be reprogrammed before October 31 of every year. Going past this date will summon a dark alter ego of hers, called Hallow Meister.



Her name "Meikane" (冥歌音) comes from the meaning "Dark Singing Sound" or "Sound of Underworld Song" and "Kiru" (キル) meaning "to cut (referring to the item Death Scythe) or Kill". This is actually the kanji Kiru (切る) written in katakana. She's sometimes named "Kira" meaning Killer and is a pun & taunt for her, because in character, she never knew why she was named Kiru.
