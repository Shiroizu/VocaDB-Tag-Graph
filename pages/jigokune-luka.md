#Derivative

**Jigokune Luka** (地獄音ルカ) is a FANLOID derivative of the VOCALOID [Megurine Luka](https://vocadb.net/Ar/2), owned by Crypton Future Media. She was created by Benzarro85 in April 2020.

Jigokune Luka was created as Benzarro85's interpretation of an ANTILOID Luka derivative would be. To sum up, she is based on Zatsune Miku, being a gothic, sexier version of Megurine Luka.

When she eats pufferfish sushi, she cannot die.
