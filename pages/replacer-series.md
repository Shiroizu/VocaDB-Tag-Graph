#Series

An original song series by Kyaramel

The series focuses around a girl named Mazui, Tsurasane (辛さ音マズイ). Her life and views are represented in the songs and retell old and current events happening throughout her life. 
From what is known so far about Mazui, she comes off as a pessimistic and depressed person. Singing (through flower) about losing her best friend, struggling to move on and trying to accept that things have changed since they first met.
