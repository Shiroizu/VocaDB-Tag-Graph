#Instruments

> A _capacitor_ is a device that stores electrical energy in an electric field by virtue of accumulating electric charges on two close surfaces insulated from each other. The capacitor was originally known as the _condenser_, a term still encountered in a few compound names, such as the condenser microphone. _(from Wikipedia)_
