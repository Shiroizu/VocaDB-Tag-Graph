#Editor_notes

Used when PV subtitles do not correspond to the actual song, in part or entirely. Can happen when the original subbed PV is reused for a "changed lyrics" cover, or when a shorter/longer cover's PV is produced via video editing from parts of a pre-subbed PV from a different version of the song, rearranging, cutting out and repeating its segments.
