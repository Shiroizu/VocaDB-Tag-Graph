>An alphabet is a standard set of letters (basic written symbols or graphemes) that represent the phonemes (basic significant sounds) of any spoken language it is used to write. This is in contrast to other types of writing systems, such as syllabaries (in which each character represents a syllable) and logographic systems (in which each character represents a word, morpheme, or semantic unit). *(Wikipedia)*

This tag can be used for songs/albums about or featuring the alphabet. It may also be used for entries dealing with letters/characters and lettering as a main theme; as such, the distinctive [Synth-V](https://vocadb.net/T/6745/synthesizer-v) [Dreamtonics](https://vocadb.net/Ar/76460) voicebanks (and all imitators of them) are a valid example of this tag.
