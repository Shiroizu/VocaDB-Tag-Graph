#Genres

Freeform hardcore, commonly known as freeform, is a grittier version of trancecore, often employing distortion and sometimes darker themes as oppose to the cleaner arpeggios of non-freeform trancecore. It is characterized by high tempos ranging from 160 to 200 on average, influences of UK hardcore and trance, including trance-styled kicks and synths, implementing heavy amounts of acid (more than acid techno and hard trance), heavy use of reverb, and an overall synthesized style of production.
