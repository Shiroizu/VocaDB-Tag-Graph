#Genres

>Country music (frequently referred to as just country) is a musical genre that originated in the Southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from genres such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music) and blues. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, steel guitars (such as pedal steels and dobros), and fiddles as well as harmonicas. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. (from Wikipedia)
