The sacabambaspis is an extinct genus of jawless fish from the [Ordovician period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordovician). As of late the sacabambaspis has gained popularity on the internet thanks to a poorly made reconstruction in [The Natural History Museum of Helsinki, Finland](https://www.luomus.fi/en/natural-history-museum).
