#Genres

Entries that imitate Maretu's style. Think syncopated [alt rock](https://vocadb.net/T/16/alternative-rock) with heavy [chiptune](https://vocadb.net/T/62/chiptune) instrumentation, often accompanied by [dark](https://vocadb.net/T/2957/dark), [ero-guro](https://vocadb.net/T/4753/ero-guro) lyrics and [monochrome](https://vocadb.net/T/7527/monochrome) lyric videos.

 __N.B.:__
  * songs by Maretu (including covers/arrangements of their works) do not count as Maretu-style;
  * not every song by a producer tagged with "Maretu-style" should also be tagged -- only those that fit the description above.
