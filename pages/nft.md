#Sources

From Wikipedia:
>A non-fungible token (NFT) is a financial security consisting of digital data stored in a blockchain, a form of distributed ledger.
The ownership of an NFT is recorded in the blockchain, and can be transferred by the owner, allowing NFTs to be sold and traded.
NFTs can be created by anybody, and require few or no coding skills to create.
NFTs typically contain references to digital files such as photos, videos, and audio.
Because NFTs are uniquely identifiable assets, they differ from cryptocurrencies, which are fungible.


This tag may be used for songs/voicebanks/art/etc. that are sold in conjunction with NFTs, or artists who are active in selling NFTs; it may also be used for songs *about* NFTs.
