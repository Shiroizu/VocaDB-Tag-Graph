#Genres

Power metal is a style of heavy metal combining characteristics of heavy metal with speed metal, often within symphonic context and synthesizer sounds. Similar to speed metal, the beat is very fast, often coupled with a double bass drum. Typically, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound and themes. The vocals are often more high note than heavy metal and, except for extreme power metal, the vocals are usually clear (no growling).
