#Vocalists

Originally known as Voicing, AmadeuSY was a set of free AI programs, including both art synthesis and singing synthesis. Only the singing synthesis program was available up until it's discontinuation, as the art synthesis program was still undergoing its training (as built entirely off the works of one 'Hoshio').
Up until the programs discontinuation, it had seven voices: [Namine Ritsu](https://vocadb.net/Ar/93319), [Akesato](https://vocadb.net/Ar/95424), [Tsukishiro Hakupo](https://vocadb.net/Ar/109085), â€‹[Tokina Shigure](https://vocadb.net/Ar/107819), [Hoshine Yuu](https://vocadb.net/Ar/120871), [Yukino Tokeru](https://vocadb.net/Ar/120870), and [Amano Naoki](https://vocadb.net/Ar/136679). An unreleased voicebank for [Ofuton-P](https://vocadb.net/Ar/121222) has been used in demo songs, and a voicebank for [Yakune Haru](https://vocadb.net/Ar/91088) was proposed but scrapped.
The development of both of the progams seemingly ceased at the end of 2023 with the websites that were related to it being taken down at around that time. The download links to AmadeuSY and it's voicebanks later stopped working somewhere around the early months of 2024.
