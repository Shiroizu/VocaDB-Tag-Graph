#Genres

>Breakcore is a style of electronic dance music influenced by hardcore, jungle, digital hardcore and industrial music that is characterized by its use of heavy kick drums, breaks and a wide palette of sampling sources, played at high tempos. Songs structure is often non-linear: the breakbeats don't stay the same throughout the song like in drum n bass for example, but rather different breaks are chopped, changed and mashed together. Samples from any spectrum of pop culture (Hollywood movies, Anime, video games, pop music) are also common, and Ragga-Breakcore with the reggae samples is a popular sub-genre.
