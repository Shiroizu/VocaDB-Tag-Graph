#Games

> Fortnite Festival is a 2023 rhythm game developed by Harmonix and published by Epic Games. 
In the game, players perform songs while attempting to achieve the highest score possible based on their performance. 
Each song features four different instruments, and players choose which instrument they want to play, as well as the song's difficulty; higher difficulties change the layouts of the songs. 
A variety of songs can be chosen from, with a free selection that changes daily, as well as the opportunity to purchase songs outright from the Fortnite item shop. 
Available songs range from those composed by Epic Games Sound Team to tracks from popular artists.
