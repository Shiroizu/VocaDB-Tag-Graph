#Sources

Extended (long) versions of songs. In most cases these should be marked **as remixes**.

Other song types:
- Original song (if short version released later)
- Remaster (if also a remaster and not just an extended version)

Only use this tag for songs by the **original artist/producer**.
If possible, add the "short version" tag to the "counterpart" song entry.
