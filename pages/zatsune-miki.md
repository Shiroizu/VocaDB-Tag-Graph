#Derivative

Zatsune Miki is the FANLOID derived from [VOCALOID Hatsune Miku](https://vocadb.net/Ar/1), from Crypton Future Media Inc.. She was created by an unknown user in 2014.

Miki is Zatsune Miku's younger sister. When people recolor Miku's illustrations from black and red without additional editing to try to get Zatsune Miku, they end up getting Miki.

Illustration by KEI (recolor).
