From [Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%A6%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%83%94%E3%82%A2)

>A utopia is an imagined community or society that possesses highly desirable or nearly perfect qualities for its citizens. The opposite of a utopia is a dystopia. One could also say that utopia is a perfect "place" that has been designed so there are no problems.
