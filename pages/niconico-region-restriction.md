#Distribution

For entries that are blocked on Niconico for users outside Japan.

At the end of October 2024, Nico Video (NND) revised its guidelines and TOS â€” adding restrictions for overseas users (users outside of Japan).
This affects videos, thumbnails, comments, and other content throughout associated Nico platforms.

The restrictions apply to:
- Content that contains abuse, sexual exploitation, sexual intercourse of children, or people that resemble children or animals.
- Content that contains excessive violence, promotes suicide, self-injury, terrorism, or the manufacture or sale of illegal drugs or weapons.
- Other content that may violate laws, rules, or regulations in the country or region where it is used.

### **Even so, the PV should not be marked as unavailable.**
