From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolf):
>In folklore, a werewolf, or occasionally lycanthrope, is a human with the ability to shapeshift into a wolf (or, especially in modern film, a therianthropic hybrid wolf-like creature), either purposely or after being placed under a curse or affliction (often a bite or scratch from another werewolf) and especially on the night of a full moon.
