#Vocalists

Content that could be useful in comparing different voicebanks or versions of the same voicebank. For example:

  * Songs which alternate between multiple subvariants of the same vocalist within one song, and annotate which one is currently singing;

  * Multiple covers of the same song by the same producer, otherwise identical and differing only in the voicebank used; can also tag producers known to make such cover series.
