Boku no Pico is a Japanese original video animation (OVA) hentai series produced by Natural High. Described as "the world's first shotacon anime" by its producer, it was primarily marketed to a male audience. The series consists of three episodes and a version of the first episode edited for content, and later spawned a one-shot manga, a computer game, and a music video album.
