#Genres

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_and_blues)

>Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B, is a genre of popular music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when "urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, one or more saxophones, and sometimes background vocalists.

This tag is for songs that imitate 1950s and 1970s R&B, including slow jam, and quiet storm music.
It also serves as a root tag for tags indicating that genres were originated by R&B, such as funk, soul, rock and roll and modern R&B.
