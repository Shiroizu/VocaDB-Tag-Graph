An upgraded version of VOICEROID+ released on October 30th, 2014. It uses the 3rd generation AITalk engine, which allows for more natural and vibrant voices. VOICEROID+ EX also gives the user more control over phrase-level adjustments like prosody and speed.

This tag is used for songs that are confirmed to use a VOICEROID+ voicebank, or for labelling voicebanks that received a VOICEROID+ release.
