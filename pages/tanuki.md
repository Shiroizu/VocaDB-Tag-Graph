> A small, heavy-set, fox-like mammal native to East Asia.
The raccoon dog is named for the resemblance of its masked face to that of the North American common raccoon.
The closest relatives of the raccoon dogs are the true foxes, not the raccoon, one of the musteloids, which are not closely related.
Common raccoon dogs feed on many animals and plant matter, and are unusual among canids (dogs, foxes, and other members of the family Canidae) for climbing trees and for hibernating in cold winters.
