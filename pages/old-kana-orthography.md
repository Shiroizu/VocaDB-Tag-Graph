#Lyrics

For songs where the lyrics are written in pre-modern kana orthography. This is standard for [classical Japanese](https://vocadb.net/T/9522), and may also be used for modern language.

Such songs must be treated carefully when romanizing due to the non-straightforward relationship between the kana and the pronunciation.
