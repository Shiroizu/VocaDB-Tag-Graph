#Genres

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_punk):
>Pop punk (also known as punk-pop or pop-punk) is a genre of rock music that combines influences of pop music with punk rock. Fast tempos, prominent electric guitars with distortion, and power chord changes are typically played under pop-influenced melodies and vocal styles with lighthearted lyrical themes including boredom, rebellion and teenage romance.
