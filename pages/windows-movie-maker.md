From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Movie_Maker):
>Windows Movie Maker (known as Windows Live Movie Maker for the 2009 and 2011 releases) is a discontinued video editing software program by Microsoft.
It was first included in Windows Me on September 14, 2000 and in Windows XP on October 25, 2001.
It was a part of the Windows Essentials software suite, and offered the ability to create and edit videos as well as to publish them on OneDrive, Facebook, Vimeo, YouTube, Windows Live Groups, and Flickr.
It is comparable to Apple’s iMovie.
Movie Maker was officially discontinued on January 10, 2017, and it is replaced by Video Editor (formerly Microsoft Story Remix) which is built in with Microsoft Photos on Windows 10, and Clipchamp on Windows 11, which Microsoft acquired in September 2021.
