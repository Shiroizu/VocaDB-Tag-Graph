#Composition

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation_(music)):
>In music, modulation is the change from one tonality (tonic, or tonal center) to another. This may or may not be accompanied by a change in key signature (a key change).

This tag are used for songs that have key change thorough the music:
* by moving up or down (ex: [モザイクロール ](https://vocadb.net/S/1381)); or
* by switching from major key to minor key or vice-versa (ex: [悪ノ召使](https://vocadb.net/S/1358))

For covers that changed the key from the original version, use the [changed key](https://vocadb.net/T/9109/changed-key) tag instead
