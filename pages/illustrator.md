#Jobs

Illustrator is an artist whose main role is drawing (still) images. This includes art used in music videos (PVs) and album covers.

This tag may be manually added to artists who, in addition to being another artist type (such as music producer or animator), are illustrators. Note that this is redundant if the artist type is already "illustrator".
