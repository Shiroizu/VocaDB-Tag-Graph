#Genres

Acid techno, sometimes known generally as "acid", is a genre of techno that was derived from acid house and developed in Europe in the early 1990s. It saw younger artists apply the "squelching" synthesizer sound of Chicago acid house to harder-edged techno material
The acid style was obtained largely through Roland instruments, most prominently the TB-303 bass synthesizer. The term Acid specifically refers to the harsh "acidic" squelching sound of the Roland 303. The acid sound is achieved by manipulating the resonance and cutoff frequency parameters of the synthesizer; doing so in real-time as the track is being recorded is a technique known as tweaking.

In addition to acid records imported from the US, the style was influenced by sources such as hardcore, German trance, and Belgian New beat/rave music.
