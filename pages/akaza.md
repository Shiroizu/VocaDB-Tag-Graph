#Animation

AKAZA is one of the two mascots for the [unity-chan!](https://vocadb.net/Ar/41220) voicebank, alongside [Otori Kohaku](https://vocadb.net/T/4571). While Kohaku is the mascot of Unity, AKAZA was designed specifically for the Vocaloid program. Both characters have appeared in other mediums, including a [video game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1514380/COGEN_Sword_of_Rewind__COGEN/) and a [short animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bczS5X0sHTY).
This tag is to be used for artwork, such as in PVs or illustrations, featuring AKAZA.
