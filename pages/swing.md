#Genres

>Swing music, or simply swing, is a form of jazz music that dominated in the 1930s and 1940s. It is most commonly associated with big bands that have a strong rhythm section of double bass and drums as the anchor for a lead section of brass instruments such as trumpets and trombones, woodwinds including saxophone and clarinets, and sometimes stringed instruments such as violin and guitar, medium to fast tempos, and a "lilting" swing time rhythm. The swing style, as defined by its essential approach to rhythm, is also played by small groups and solo performers on instruments such as pianos and guitars. (from Wikipedia)
