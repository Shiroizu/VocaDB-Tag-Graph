>Rosa, commonly known as Rose, is a genus of about 150 species of deciduous or semi-evergreen perennials in the family Rosaceae, native to the regions of the Northern Hemisphere.
Roses are one of the most popular flowers in the world prized for its beauty, as well as its many useful qualities. They are famous for their strong fragrance and attractive multi-petalled flowers surrounded by the strong and sharp thorns of the Rose bush. Flowers vary in size and shape and are often followed by red or purple fruits known as “Rose hips”. Roses are great for any floral occasion.

- The red variant often gets used to symbolize "love", while the white variant symbolizes "innocence" or "innocent love".
