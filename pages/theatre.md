#Themes

Songs and albums that reference or are set in a theatre or a stage. Theatres are where most performing arts (dance, acting, music, etc.) are traditionally performed, featuring live artists of various types before an equally live audience.

Stage motifs often include references to the curtains, stage lights (especially spotlights), taking a bow, encores, scripts, the audience, and even performances as a general idea. These often act as metaphors about the "scripted" or "performed" nature of things, through foregone conclusions or false affectations. Some instead focus on the audience aspect, and may even reference the ['fourth wall'](https://vocadb.net/T/4568/meta) that separates the petformers from the watchers.

The art is by [Yorukaze](https://vocadb.net/Ar/93626).
