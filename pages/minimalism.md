#Genres

From [Discogs](https://reference.discogslabs.com/style/minimal):

>While minimalism is hard to define precisely, its aesthetic can be summarized by the saying "less is more", like cold-wave bands looking for a empty sound in the 80's. When used by itself, it generally denotes electronic music that uses only one synthesizer and one drum machine, without complex, layered melodies and instruments. Usually no vocals.
