#Derivative

Tobarine Luno is a genderswap based on [Tobarine Yano](https://vocadb.net/Ar/84896).

Luno's voice is achieved by applying the parameter g-15 to any voicebank of [Tobarine Yano](https://vocadb.net/Ar/84896).

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
