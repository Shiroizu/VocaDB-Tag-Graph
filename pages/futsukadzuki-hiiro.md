#Derivative

Futsukadzuki Hiiro is a derived version based on [Kyomachi Morte](https://vocadb.net/Ar/61677) achieved with the configuration of g-15~20. 

- As Futsukadzuki Hiiro has received [dedicated UTAU voicebanks](https://vocadb.net/Ar/126182), please only apply this tag to entries that are based on Kyomachi Morte's voicebanks.

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
