#Sources

Songs released for demonstrating a **voicebank** or **engine**. 
- These are often published either before the product's release, or directly *with* the [product's release](https://vocadb.net/T/9316/voicebank-release). 
- Many utilize [beta versions](https://vocadb.net/T/34/beta-voicebank) of voicebanks.

Voicebank demos for talking voicebanks are usually added with the [**other** song type](https://vocadb.net/T/10159/other-song-type).
