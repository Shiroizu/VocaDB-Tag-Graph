#Genres

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_punk#Easycore) 
>Easycore (less commonly known as popcore, dudecore, softcore, happy hardcore, "bro" pop punk, and EZ) is a subgenre of melodic hardcore that mixes elements of pop punk and different forms of hardcore punk, particularly metalcore and post-hardcore. It is characterized by its use of melodies commonly found in pop punk fused with breakdowns found in post-hardcore and hardcore punk. A number of groups also take influence from metal and make use of unclean vocals.

Easycore is not a synonym for or related to [easy listening](https://vocadb.net/T/117/easy-listening).
