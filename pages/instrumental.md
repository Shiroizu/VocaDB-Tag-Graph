#Vocalists

Songs and albums with no vocals (Vocaloid or otherwise), or where the vocals are clearly in an exceptionally minor role compared to the rest of the instruments.

Generally, instrumental songs are only allowed when they appear together on an album with Vocaloid songs, or they have covers or remixes with Vocaloid vocals. Fully instrumental albums should not be added on VocaDB, but predominantly instrumental albums with a few in-scope works are allowed. Please add all instrumental and otherwise out-of-scope tracks in albums to the database directly; only use custom tracks for songs made by fully out-of-scope artists or albums with an amount of out-of-scope content too large to reasonably add.

In case of an off-vocal version of a song, select the Instrumental song type instead.
