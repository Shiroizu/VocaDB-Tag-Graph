#Lyrics

This tag prevents automatic lyrics fetching from the original entry. Use this if the lyrics are different from the original (for example, the song has parody lyrics).

If changing the lyrics is the only thing that was done, most of the time these songs should use the "cover" type. If the musical style is different, then remix takes priority.
