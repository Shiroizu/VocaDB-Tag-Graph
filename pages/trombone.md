#Instruments

The trombone is a brass instrument with a characteristic telescoping slide to alter its pitch, though some models uses valves like every other brass instruments. It's a regular member of orchestras and concert bands.
The most common modern trombone are tenor and bass trombones, both pitched in Bâ™­. Unlike the [trumpet](https://vocadb.net/T/2812/trumpet), the trombone plays as their written part in bass clef. The only exception is in British brass bands, where the tenor trombone's part uses treble clef and plays a major second lower than written.
