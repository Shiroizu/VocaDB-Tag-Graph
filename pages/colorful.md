This tag refers to works that utilize a multicolored or "[rainbow](https://vocadb.net/T/6553)" color palette.
This isn't just for creations where one tone is given dominance and two more are used to back it; this is specifically for works where 3 or more colors are given equal amounts of focus.

This tag can be used:
- characters who equally utilize 3 or more colors thematically
- songs, albums, and videos that utilize 3 or more colors thematically

**This is a theme color tag! These tags are meant to denote videos or characters with a distinctive focal color, or songs *about* said color. Not everything needs to be tagged with these.**
