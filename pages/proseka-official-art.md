#Animation

Tag for song or album entries which use official artworks/images (of the characters) of the game "[Project SEKAI COLORFUL STAGE! feat. Hatsune Miku](https://vocadb.net/T/7323/proseka)".

- Note that this tag can be used for songs that do not need to be specifically about ProSeka and just use the artwork.
