#Derivative

For songs or albums that explicitly define the use of the derivative, **Hanna Van Sparx**.

She is a derived voice configuration for the VOCALOID [CYBER DIVA](http://vocadb.net/Ar/48800).
>"Hannaâ€™s voice is created with a sophisticated hi-tech computer program, each and every note is individually programmed until the desired words are created. They are then arranged into the melody that the song requires" --*Hanna's Official Website*

Hanna was created by [Corlioni](http://vocadb.net/Ar/55071).

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
