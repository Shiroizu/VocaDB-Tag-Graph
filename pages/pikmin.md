Pikmin is a real-time strategy and puzzle video game series created by Shigeru Miyamoto, and published by Nintendo. The games focus on directing a horde of plant-like creatures called Pikmin to collect items by destroying obstacles, avoiding hazards, and fighting fauna that are hazardous to both the player character and the Pikmin.

The Pikmin series features four main entries, and also two spin-offs. The first two, Pikmin (2001) and Pikmin 2 (2004), were made and released for the GameCube and later ported to the Wii as New Play Control! titles in 2008 and 2009. Pikmin 2 was re-released in the Nintendo Selects series in 2012. Both titles were remastered for the Nintendo Switch in 2023 as Pikmin 1+2. A third installment, Pikmin 3, was released for the Wii U in 2013. An enhanced port of Pikmin 3 for the Nintendo Switch, Pikmin 3 Deluxe, was released in 2020. The series' first handheld game, Hey! Pikmin, was released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2017. Pikmin 4 was released for the Nintendo Switch in 2023. Pikmin Bloom, the series' mobile spin-off, was released for iOS and Android in 2021. Pikmin Finder, a augmented reality browser-based mobile game, was released in 2023.
