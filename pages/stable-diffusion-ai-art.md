>Stable Diffusion is a deep learning, text-to-image model released in 2022.
It is primarily used to generate detailed images conditioned on text descriptions, though it can also be applied to other tasks such as inpainting, outpainting, and generating image-to-image translations guided by a text prompt.
Stable Diffusion is a latent diffusion model, a variety of deep generative neural network developed by the CompVis group at LMU Munich.
The model has been released by a collaboration of Stability AI, CompVis LMU, and Runway with support from EleutherAI and LAION.
In October 2022, Stability AI raised US$101 million in a round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners and Coatue Management.
Stable Diffusion's code and model weights have been released publicly, and it can run on most consumer hardware equipped with a modest GPU with at least 8Â GB VRAM.
This marked a departure from previous proprietary text-to-image models such as DALL-E and Midjourney which were accessible only via cloud services.
