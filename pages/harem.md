#Themes

An emphasis on polygamous or love triangle relationships characterized by a protagonist surrounded amorously by three or more members of either the same or opposing gender, sex or love interests.

When it is a yuri or male-hetero oriented harem series, the polygynous relationship is informally referred to as a female harem or seraglios. When it is a yaoi or female-hetero oriented harem series, the polyandrous relationship is informally referred to as a male harem, reverse harem, or gyaku hāremu (逆ハーレム).

The word derives from Harem, which was a term used to refer to the most private rooms of a household in the Islamic world, especially among the upper class where only women and close relatives were permitted inside.
