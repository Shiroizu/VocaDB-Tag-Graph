#Subjective

Tag for songs that give off the feeling of "decay", "frayedness" or "wobbliness"; this is particularly characteristic of some lo-fi songs, songs with strange rhythm or "trashy" songs.

Apparently, the term was first used on [ManHoleMan](https://vocadb.net/Ar/49347)'s song, [manhole](https://vocadb.net/S/126879).
