#Themes

> Commonly known as _dandelions_ (from French dent-de-lion, meaning 'lion's tooth'), Taraxacum is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. The genus is native to Eurasia and North America, but the two most commonplace species worldwide, T. officinale (the common dandelion) and T. erythrospermum (the red-seeded dandelion), were introduced into North America from Europe and now propagate as wildflowers. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taraxacum))

Common meanings in floriography ([Flower Meaning](https://www.flowermeaning.com/dandelion-flower-meaning/)):
* healing from emotional pain and physical injury alike;
* intelligence, especially in an emotional and spiritual sense;
* the warmth and power of the rising sun;
* surviving through all challenges and difficulties;
* long lasting happiness and youthful joy;
* getting your wish fulfilled.
