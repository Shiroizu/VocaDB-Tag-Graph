#Animation

_WOMBO Dream_ is a text-to-image AI art generator that produces original image depending on a text prompt and a chosen art style.
For instance, this image was generated with the prompt "Hatsune Miku sticks her tongue out" and the "paint" style. Note that Miku is not, in fact, sticking her tongue out, but she does have her mouth open.
