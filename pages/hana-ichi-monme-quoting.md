Katte ureshii hana ichi monme
_We're so happy we won, a flower is one monme_

Makete kuyashii hana ichi monme
_We're so upset we lost, a flower is one monme_

Ano ko ga hoshii
_We want that kid_

Ano ko ja wakaran
_We don't know which kid you mean_

Sōdan shiyō
_Let's talk about it_

Sō shiyō
_Yes, let's_

[...] ga hoshii
_We want [name]_

[...] ga hoshii
_We want [name]_
