#Genres

Ska is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s, mostly associated with reggae. It combines elements of mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. Ska focuses on off-beat rhythms, utilizes horn sections and walking bass, and guitar/organ is often played with chop chords.
