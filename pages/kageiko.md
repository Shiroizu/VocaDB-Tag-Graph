#Derivative

**Shion Kageiko**, otherwise referred to as **KAGEIKO**, is the genderswapped subderivative of **KAGEITO**, created by [墨汁](https://vocadb.net/Ar/23949) (Bokujyuu), and is the FANLOID derivatives of both KAITO and KAIKO. She was created by an unknown user, and was revamped by Benzarro85 on December 27th, 2024.

KAGEIKO was created to serve as a twin sister and a genderswapped version of KAGEITO. Originally, her page was created on the FANLOID Wiki in 2014 by a user named Count Zatsune, but she was not as popular as her twin, with little to no recognition. Her creator was unnamed, and she had no voice.

Her project was likely abandoned due to her page's recent update dating back to 2015.

At sometime, there were little fan-artworks of her, alongside MMD models, making people believe that she was basically forgotten.

KAGEIKO takes on the same personality and tropes as her twin brother, by being a yandere. She sleeps during the day and stays awake at night. Because her skin is so pale, she hates the sunlight, and makes sure her room is dark at all times. She enjoys bothering KAGEITO whenever she can, and has a hatred for people with an "over-the-top" personality.

She is introverted.

KAGEIKO enjoys playing videogames on her Xbox, such as Fortnite, as it is one of the many things that keeps her awake. Another thing is producing music, reading, writing and of course, sleeping. She hates being woken up by any of the members of the Shion Family.
