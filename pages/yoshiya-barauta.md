#Derivative

Yoshiya Barauta is a genderswap based on [Yume Barauta](https://vocadb.net/Ar/82248).

Yoshiya is on the left, while his "twin"/original voicebank, Yume, is on the right.

He later on received [his own voicebank](https://vocadb.net/Ar/147224) under a new name after his sister was also revamped.

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
