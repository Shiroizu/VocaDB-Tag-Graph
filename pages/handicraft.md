>A handicraft, sometimes more precisely expressed as artisanal handicraft or handmade, is any of a wide variety of types of work where useful and decorative objects are made completely by hand or by using only simple tools. --from Wikipedia

A handicraft can range from little wooden statuettes, to beadwork dolls, to the plushies shown in the thumbnail here. [シコンス](https://vocadb.net/Ar/62284) has made stuffies of multiple Vocaloids, and the ones shown here from left to right are: [Aoi Kotonoha](https://vocadb.net/Ar/40989), [Maki Tsurumaki](https://vocadb.net/Ar/2053), [Yukari Yuzuki](https://vocadb.net/Ar/623), [Zunko Tohoku](https://vocadb.net/Ar/88771), and [Akane Kotonoha](https://vocadb.net/Ar/40988).
