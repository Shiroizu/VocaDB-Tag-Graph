#Genres

"Piano Rock is a style of rock music that is based around the piano, as opposed to most traditional rock music, which is based around the guitar. In fact some artists, such as Keane, eschew guitars completely.

Piano Rock has been a popular style since the 1970s, beginning with artists such as Elton John and Billy Joel, and it has continued to be so to this day, with the likes of Keane, Ben Folds, and Tori Amos."
