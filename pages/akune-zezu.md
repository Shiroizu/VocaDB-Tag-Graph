#Derivative

She was intentionally created to be Teto's flaw based on Haku, said by her creator, [KEdd-P](https://vocadb.net/Ar/82463).
On April 15, 2020, Yulian spoke with the original creator of Zezu, asking him if he would "revive" Zezu Akune's project. JanexLane responded that probably not, and that he was no longer interested in his project. Then Yulian asked if he could adopt her, and JanexLane agreed, saying that he wouldn't use her anymore and that it was okay with him. Currently, Zezu Akune has been adopted by Yulian The Teen and [PSiCO](https://vocadb.net/Ar/66828).
