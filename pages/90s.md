#Themes

Use this tag when a song takes its aesthetics (musically, graphically, etc.) from the 90s or is about the 90s.

Do not tag blindly based on the publish date.

Art by [エキストリーム納豆](https://vocadb.net/Ar/48506). It depicts [Zunko Tohoku](https://vocadb.net/Ar/16933) in high-waisted beige pants, a baggy dark green jacket, a light green button-up, and a big dark green tie. Her hair is bunched up in a high pony tail, kept up in the air by a big purple bow.
