#Distribution

Use this tag when artists make their songs' stem data officially available for download.

> Music _stems_ are a type of audio file that breaks down a complete track into individual mixes. _Stems_ tend to break down into four tracks, usually covering the melody, instruments, bass, and drums.
When the song _stems_ are played simultaneously, without any changes, the track should sound like the finished, mastered version â€“ or at least as close as can be. This is why music _stems_ are widely used by DJs and other artists when doing remixes.
_(from [epidemicsound.com](https://www.epidemicsound.com/blog/what-are-stems-in-music-production/))_

Stems also tend to include rendered vocal tracks.

__N.B.:__ this tag indicates that stem downloads are available at any time, as opposed to _[stem data distribution (VocaColle)](https://vocadb.net/T/9534)_.
