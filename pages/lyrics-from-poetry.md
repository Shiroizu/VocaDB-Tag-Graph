#Lyrics

"Poetry" and "lyrics" are very similar creatures, with the former often being viewed as subsection of the latter. Is it any surprise, then, that some people will gather others' poetry so as to form the lyrics of their song? This tag is for songs that utilize (often older) poems created by other people. Notably, the poems must have existed first as *poems*, and were not initially intended to be made into lyrics.

Not to be confused with [poemloid](https://vocadb.net/T/3355/poemloid), a genre featuring spoken word or beat poetry accompanied by background music.
