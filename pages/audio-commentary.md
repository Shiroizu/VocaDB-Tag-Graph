#Themes

Tag for album songs which are completely or in significant part talking by the producer(s) or/and other vocalist(s), without music, or music only for atmospheric purposes. These tracks are usually bonus or intro tracks.

For songs with talking as "vocals", use the [talkloid](http://vocadb.net/T/423/talkloid) tag.
