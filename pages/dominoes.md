> Dominoes is a family of tile-based games played with gaming pieces, commonly known as dominoes. 
Each domino is a rectangular tile, usually with a line dividing its face into two square ends. 
Each end is marked with a number of spots (also called pips or dots) or is blank. 
The backs of the tiles in a set are indistinguishable, either blank or having some common design. The gaming pieces make up a domino set, sometimes called a deck or pack. 
The traditional European domino set consists of 28 tiles, also known as pieces, bones, rocks, stones, men, cards or just dominoes, featuring all combinations of spot counts between zero and six. 
A domino set is a generic gaming device, similar to playing cards or dice, in that a variety of games can be played with a set. 
Another form of entertainment using domino pieces is the practice of domino toppling.
