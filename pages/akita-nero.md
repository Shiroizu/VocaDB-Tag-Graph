#Derivative

Akita Nero is the assumed little brother of Akita Neru. He is also a product of so-called anti-Miku campaign.

Contrary to popular belief, Nero is a creation of Smith Hioka, and did not originate from Rena-tan (formerly; Hankyou). Nero's origins are connected to Neru herself.

In October of 2007, Miku's pictures became unavailable to search in main search engines in Japan, which incident led to the birth of Neru. Most search engines became normal again in a few days, but Yahoo! Japan showed unusual results nearly for a month. On November 21, 2007, the 2ch board discussed in the thread 2 Miku related news, that abnormalities were noted. After the report, the company seemed to debug the search engine according to each of the 2ch user's indications. Soon the users made a spoof character Nero as "Neru's younger brother and a Yahoo! programmer who was debugging the program manually". His concept art was released on the following day.
(...)
Kinship between Neru and Nero is rather sketchy. He may be considered Neru's little brother, but he may be also Neru's genderswap. None are officially confirmed.

Much like how Neru is sometimes paired with Len, he is sometimes paired with Kagamine Rin by Western fans.

- Many people like to believe his character item is a fork and cheese.
- In some fanworks by the Japanese fandom, they depict Nero as a crossdresser.
