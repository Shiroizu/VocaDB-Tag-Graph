Collage (/kəˈlɑːʒ/, from the French: coller, "to glue" or "to stick together";) is a technique of art creation, primarily used in the visual arts, but in music too, by which art results from an assemblage of different forms, thus creating a new whole. (Compare with pastiche, which is a "pasting" together.) - [Wikipedia (EN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collage)

- used for artists/videos/album covers using collage style
