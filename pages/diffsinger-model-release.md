#Vocalists

* If an DiffSinger bank is released with a download link in a song or PV description, use this tag.
* If there are multiple songs marking a release of an DiffSinger bank, only tag the first song that marks the release.
* If an DiffSinger bank has multiple releases, use this tag to mark each voicebank release. Note the VB release in the song's description if there are multiple.
