#Animation

Yukkuri are chibi, disembodied head versions of various [Touhou](https://vocadb.net/T/431/touhou-project) characters. They're a highly in-depth fan creation, having detailed life cycles, personalities, and other such ecological curiosities.

Yukkuri Reimu was the first Yukkuri to be made, and is the most famous and popular of them all. [Female Voice 1 from the AquesTalk](https://vocadb.net/Ar/11830) [or SofTalk programs](https://vocadb.net/Ar/116100) is frequently used to voice the Yukkuri version of Reimu, right up to being the previous image for Female Voice 1's artist entry. [Yukkuri](https://vocadb.net/Ar/118892), the UTAU port of Female Voice 1, officially utilizes the meme; however, due to the general oddities of the voicebank, this tag may still be applied to it.

Much like [ALT](https://vocadb.net/T/9328/alt), this tag refers to a famous fan design/character that is more renowned than the voicebank it utilizes. This tag can applied to:
* Songs and albums that refer to Female Voice 1 (AquesTalk or SofTalk) as "Reimu" or "Yukkuri Reimu", or otherwise use Yukkuri Reimu to represent Female Voice 1
* Songs that use Yukkuri, the UTAU port, while utilizing the memetic imagery or similar
* Songs and albums that feature Yukkuri Reimu in their illustrations or animations
