#Themes

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel):
>An angel is generally a supernatural being found in various religions and mythologies. In Abrahamic religions, angels are often depicted as benevolent celestial beings who act as intermediaries between God or Heaven and humanity. Other roles of angels include protecting and guiding human beings, and carrying out God's tasks.

Applies to songs/albums about angels, and vocalists who are depicted as angels.
