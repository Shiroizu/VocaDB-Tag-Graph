#Vocalists

This tag applies to songs that feature only one vocalist, but the vocalist is featured in multiple roles as if they're singing a chorus or duet, for example:

* The same voicebank is used for multiple roles in the same song (ex. Gachapoid's cover of "[Hello Laughter](https://vocadb.net/S/68802)"), often with different tuning between different renderings of the voicebank (ex. "[Hatsune](https://vocadb.net/S/176884)")
* Different sub-voicebanks of the same base vocalist are used for multiple roles (ex. "[Hatsune Miku's Division → Destruction](https://vocadb.net/S/3802)")

This tag does not apply if a song uses multiple sub-voicebanks, but are collectively intended to be used as the same vocalist as opposed to putting them in chorus/duet-like roles (for example, KulfiQ's "[Charon](https://vocadb.net/S/6935)" uses multiple sub-voicebanks, but they are all used as different settings of the same vocalist rather than as a chorus or duet).
