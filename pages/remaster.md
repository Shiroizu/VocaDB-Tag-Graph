#Sources

Remaster ("修正版" or "リマスター版" in Japanese) means an improved/remastered version of a song. Sometimes artists may replace the original song with a remastered version, even deleting the original. In that case it's not necessary to add another entry for the original, and the remaster can use the "original song" type.

#### Tag usage notes
For albums where significant number of the songs are known to be remastered.
