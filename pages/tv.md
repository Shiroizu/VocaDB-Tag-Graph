The television is an audio-visual medium where one can watch [shows](https://vocadb.net/T/8808/tv-show), [films](https://vocadb.net/T/8803/movie), and other such works. This tag can refer to works that reference a TV, TV shows, or similar things. It is also a catch-all parent tag to TV show copyright tags.

The art is by [まちまち](https://vocadb.net/Ar/67918), featuring [Miku](https://vocadb.net/Ar/1) and an aptly labelled TV.
