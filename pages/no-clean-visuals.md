#Editor_notes

For song entries where the only archive of the PV is obscured or modified in some way.

Illustration by [ToroP](https://vocadb.net/Ar/101549), showing a segment of the PV for [I Want to Eat Red Bean Paste(?)](https://vocadb.net/S/520422) that is almost completely obscured by livestream comments.
