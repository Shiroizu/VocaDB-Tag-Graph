#Themes

Chinese New Year is the festival that celebrates the beginning of a new year on the traditional lunisolar Chinese calendar. Spring Festival is celebrated between 21 January and 20 February each year.
The festival is associated with the colour red for happiness, red envelopes containing money and home coming to the family. Each year is associated with a different animal from the Chinese Zodiac.
