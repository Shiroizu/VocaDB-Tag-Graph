#Copyrights

> A Japanese detective manga series written and illustrated by Gosho Aoyama. It has been serialized in Shogakukan's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Sunday since January 1994, with its chapters collected in 103 tankōbon volumes as of April 2023. Due to legal problems with the name Detective Conan, the English language releases from Funimation and Viz Media were renamed to Case Closed.

Due to how heavily interconnected the two series are, this tag will include entries from the side story Magic Kaito/Magic Kaito 1412.
