#Vocalists

pitagoe is a set of sample packs released by [AH-Software](https://vocadb.net/Ar/192). It's akin to [exVoice](https://vocadb.net/T/4757) in its purpose and function, with pre-recorded sounds and lines that people can utilize in songs and videos.

This tag may be added to:
* voicebanks that come with an attached pitagoe sample pack
* songs that utilize the pitagoe sample packs
* albums that contain the aforementioned songs

**If pitagoe samples of a character not otherwise in the song are used, please list the character in the description with a link back to them.**
