#Themes

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ero_guro):
>Ero guro puts its focus on eroticism, sexual corruption, and decadence. While ero guro is a specific movement, many of its components can be found throughout Japanese history and culture. [...] In actuality the "grotesqueness" implied in the term refers to things that are malformed, unnatural, or horrific. Items that are pornographic and bloody are not necessarily ero guro, and vice versa. The term is often used incorrectly by western audiences to mean "gore"—depictions of horror, blood, and guts.
