#Themes

**Dark fantasy** is a subgenre of **fantasy** literary, artistic, and cinematic works that incorporate **darker** and **frightening** themes of fantasy. It also often combines fantasy with elements of **horror** or has a **gloomy**, **dark** (or **grimdark**) atmosphere, or a sense of **horror** and **dread**.

- **Grimdark** is a subgenre of **speculative fiction** with a tone, style, or setting that is particularly **dystopian**, **amoral**, or **violent**. The term is inspired by the tagline of the tabletop strategy game Warhammer 40,000: "*In the grim darkness of the far future there is only WAR.*"
