The 60th film produced by the studio, it was directed by Jared Bush and Byron Howard, co-directed by writer Charise Castro Smith who co-wrote the screenplay with Bush, and produced by Yvett Merino and Clark Spencer, with original songs written by Lin-Manuel Miranda.

The film features the voices of Stephanie Beatriz, María Cecilia Botero, John Leguizamo, Mauro Castillo, Jessica Darrow, Angie Cepeda, Carolina Gaitán, Diane Guerrero, and Wilmer Valderrama. It follows a family called the Madrigals, helmed by a matriarch whose children and grandchildren all receive magical gifts from "the miracle" that helps them serve their community in rural Colombia, except for Mirabel Madrigal (Beatriz), who does not receive a magical gift. When Mirabel learns the family is prone to losing their magic, she sets out to find out what is happening in order to save both her family and their magical house.
