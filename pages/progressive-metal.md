#Genres

>Progressive metal (also known as prog metal) is a subgenre of both progressive rock and heavy metal, originating in the United Kingdom and the United States In the 1970s. Progressive metal blended elements of heavy metal and progressive rock music, taking the loud "aggression" and amplified electric guitar-driven sound of the former, with the more experimental, complex and "pseudo-classical" compositions of the latter. Progressive metal often utilises the conceptual themes associated with progressive rock. 
Throughout the years, progressive metal has borrowed influences from several other genres, including classical and jazz fusion music.
