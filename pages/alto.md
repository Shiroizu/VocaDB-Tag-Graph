#Vocalists

The lowest **female** voice typically between F3 and F5.

___

>The musical term **alto**, meaning "high" in Italian, historically refers to the contrapuntal part higher than the **tenor** and its associated vocal range.
In 4-part voice leading **alto** is the second-highest part, sung in choruses by either low women's or high men's voices.
In vocal classification these are usually called **contralto** and **male alto** or **countertenor**.
*-Wikipedia*

>A **contralto** is a type of classical **female** singing voice whose vocal range is the lowest **female** voice type.
The **contralto's** vocal range is fairly rare; similar to the **mezzo-soprano**, and almost identical to that of a **countertenor**, typically between the F below middle C (F3 in scientific pitch notation) to the second F above middle C (F5), although, at the extremes, some voices can reach the D below middle C (D3) or the second B♭ above middle C (B♭5).
The **contralto** voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, lyric, and dramatic contralto.
