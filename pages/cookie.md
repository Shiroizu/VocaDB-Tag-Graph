Cookie☆ is a series of multi-artist collaborative Touhou fan animations inspired by Marisa and Alice's Cookie Kiss by Rio Hazuna. The original video became widely parodied for its amateur quality, particularly after the original creator resigned over grooming allegations, and it has remained a popular staple of MAD videos for over a decade.

Although the series originated from Touhou fanfiction, most Cookie☆ videos exclusively reference the animations themselves as well as associated inside jokes, and not the original Touhou series.
