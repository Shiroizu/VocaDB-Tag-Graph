#Copyrights

>**Takanori Nishikawa** is a Japanese musician, singer, songwriter, record producer, actor, voice artist, radio personality, and businessman.
He performs under the stage name **T.M.Revolution (TMR)**, which stands for "**Takanori Makes Revolution**", stemming from the famous '80s pop electronic band **TM Network**.
Despite most of his songs being written by **Akio Inoue** and composed/arranged by **Daisuke Asakura** (also **TMR's** former producer), **T.M.Revolution** is considered **Nishikawa's** solo project.
**Nishikawa** is also known for contributions of ending and opening themes to many notable anime and game series.
