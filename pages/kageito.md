#Derivative

For albums and songs that explicitly define the usage of the derivative, **KAGEITO**.

KAGEITO is a voicebank configuration of the VOCALOID [KAITO](https://vocadb.net/Ar/71). His name is a portmanteau of the words 'KAITO' and '影 (Kage)'.

He was created by [墨汁](https://vocadb.net/Ar/23949) (Bokujyuu).

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
