#Genres

Indie rock is a genre of rock music similar to early alternative rock, originally used to describe a band representing independent label, especially in the 1990s, when alternative rock entered the mainstream.

The term indie rock, which comes from "independent", describes the small and relatively low-budget labels on which it is released and the do-it-yourself attitude of the bands and artists involved. "Indie rock" began to be used to describe those bands, working in a variety of styles, that did not pursue or achieve commercial success. "Indie rock" is sometimes used interchangeably with "alternative rock".
