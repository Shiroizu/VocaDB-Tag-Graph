#Vocalists

“Hatsune Miku”, “Kagamine Rin”, “Kagamine Len”, “Megurine Luka”, “KAITO” and “MEIKO” (collectively called the “Piapro Characters”) are characters developed for a line of singing voice synthesizer products by Crypton Future Media, INC. This tag is used for songs and albums focusing on all of these characters as a group.

In the past, Crypton's characters were often informally referred to by their company name. The Piapro Characters name was officially introduced around 2016 as a way to separate the characters from the Vocaloid brand.
