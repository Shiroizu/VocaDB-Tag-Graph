#Vocalists

A VSTi plugin developed by Aquest.
There are four voice options: [Female F1](https://vocadb.net/Ar/91696), [Auto F1](https://vocadb.net/Ar/116584), [Male HK](https://vocadb.net/Ar/116586), and [Auto HK](https://vocadb.net/Ar/116583).

AquesTone has gained some popularity through the [pop'n music](https://vocadb.net/T/9329/popn-music) video game series; F1 is the voice behind [TILT](https://vocadb.net/T/8038/tilt), an in-game character created by BEMANI composer Chilt.
