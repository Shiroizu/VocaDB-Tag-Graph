#Animation

>Live2D is the technique of generating 2D animations, usually anime-style characters, using layered, continuous parts based on an illustration, without the need of frame-by-frame animation or a 3D model. This enables characters to move while maintaining the original illustration at low-cost. It can be considered as the balance of cost and effect of an animation. Live2D is also the name of the eponymous animation software series employing the technique, created by Japanese programmer Tetsuya Nakajo.
