#Derivative

Zowane Haku is the "dark version" of [Yowane Haku](https://vocadb.net/T/7217). She's the Antiloid version of Yowane, like Hatsune Miku and [Zatsune Miku](https://vocadb.net/T/494/zatsune-miku). She was created by PSiCO and Yulian The Teen in October 2016.
She is also considered to be "the evil version" of Yowane Haku, although she is not as offensive.
