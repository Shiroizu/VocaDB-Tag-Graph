#Subjective

Songs with a sweet, gentle sound; a mix of ["cute"](https://vocadb.net/T/81/cute) and ["calm"](https://vocadb.net/T/50/calm) that gives a kind of mild comfort to the listener. It's the type of music that makes one sway with a light smile on their face.

Illustration by [shino](https://vocadb.net/Ar/34380). It depicts [Kokone](https://vocadb.net/Ar/16545) and [IA](https://vocadb.net/Ar/504) against a soft, pale green background. Their hair flows gently as little sparkles rise from the ground.
