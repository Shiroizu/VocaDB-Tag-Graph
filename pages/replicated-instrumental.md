#Composition

This applies to covers where the producer has recreated the instrumental, often done when the original does not have a publicly available instrumental version. Note that this does not apply to remixes, as remixes are when the musical style is intended to be different from the original. **For a song to qualify as a "replicated instrumental", the musical style should be a recreation of the original song.**

This tag can also be attached to artists who often create these recreated instrumentals, or to cover albums if all the songs are applicable.
