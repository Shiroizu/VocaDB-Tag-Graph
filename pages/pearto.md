Known to hack phones to ignite them when called, while she works at the Teto County Fire Station, she is a serial arsonist who is "peary" good at her job. She is legally immune due to cuteness. Tastes good and is 92 calories, though on Tuesdays, she is known to be up to 2000 calories, in celebration of Teto Tuesday.
She's wanted in many countries, and even if it tastes good, it's actually a parasite and you'll slowly turn into Pearto if you even just bite her.
