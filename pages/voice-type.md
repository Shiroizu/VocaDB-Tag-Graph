#Vocalists

Umbrella tag for different voice types.

> A voice type is a group of voices with similar vocal ranges, capable of singing in a similar tessitura, and with similar vocal transition points (passaggi).
Voice classification is most strongly associated with European classical music, though it, and the terms it utilizes, are used in other styles of music as well.
