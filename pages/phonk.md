#Genres

> _Phonk_ is a subgenre of hip hop and trap music directly inspired by 1990s Memphis rap. Mostly present on the SoundCloud platform, the music is characterized by vocals from old Memphis rap tapes and samples from early-1990s hip hop, often combining them with elements of jazz and funk. The genre deploys distorting techniques such as chopped and screwed to create a darker sound.
> Initially developed in the 1990s in the Southern United States, mainly in Houston and Memphis. In the late-2010s, through streaming platforms such as SoundCloud, the genre developed more of an emphasis on jazz and classic hip-hop.
> Popularized by TikTok and the drift community in social media, "_drift phonk_" is a subgenre of _phonk_ that emerged in Russia in the late-2010s; its main features are the use of cowbells and high bass. It is generally used in lo-fi videos showing drifting cars. With the rise in popularity of _drift phonk_, the word "_phonk_" started to become more associated with the subgenre as opposed to the original genre.
