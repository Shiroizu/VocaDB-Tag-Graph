#Themes

> - A criminal is a person who commits a crime.
In ordinary language, a crime is an unlawful act punishable by a state or other authority.
> - The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes.
While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.
> - A prison, also known as a jail or gaol, penitentiary, detention center, correction center, correctional facility, lock-up, hoosegow or remand center, is a facility in which inmates (or prisoners) are confined against their will and usually denied a variety of freedoms under the authority of the state as punishment for various crimes.
> - Handcuffs are frequently used by law enforcement agencies worldwide to prevent suspected criminals from escaping from police custody.
