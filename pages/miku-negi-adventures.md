#Games

Miku Negi Adventures ("Miku Project") was a hack n' slash PC fangame made in the Irrlicht engine by "B@z" and "RiaValkyrie" through the Irrlicht forums in the late 2000s. The project used four stolen music tracks from Nico Nico Douga as BGM. An alternative version of the game with Zatsune Miku's skin by Metroblog user "Nanalyied" was available, however, Metroblog's deactivation in 2015 lead to the disappeareance of that subsequent version as well. Nowadays, it's quite difficult to play the game as most of the download links available in the past have been taken down.
