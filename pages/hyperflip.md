#Genres

Subgenre of hyperpop influenced by breakcore and jersey club with heavy use of sampling, meme references, fast paced chaotic rhythms and pitch shifting. The genre is associated with remixes and mash-ups.
Many hyperflip/ dariacore songs are tagged or marked with words ending in "-core" (goombacore, duggongcore, donaldcore). This is in reference to Jane Remover's (alias leroy) album "dariacore".
