#Themes

From [Dere Types Wiki](https://the-dere-types.wikia.com/wiki/Kuudere):
> A kuudere, sometimes written as kūdere or just kudere, refers to a character who is often cold, blunt, and cynical. They may seem very emotionless on the outside, but on the inside they’re very caring — at least when it comes to the ones they love.

This tag applies to:

* Songs where characters are portrayed as kuudere
* Albums with multiple songs featuring kuudere characters
* Artists that make songs featuring kuudere characters
* Vocalists who canonically have a kuudere personality
