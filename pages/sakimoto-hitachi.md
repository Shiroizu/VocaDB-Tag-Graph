#Derivative

**Sakimoto Hitachi** is the FANLOID derived from [VOCALOID2 Kagamine Len](https://vocadb.net/Ar/15), from Crypton Future Media, Inc.. He was originally created by Benzarro85 in Fall 2016.

Hitachi was Benzarro85's first ever FANLOID/Derivative, when he was fairly new to being in the VOCALOID community. At the time, Hitachi was voiced by Len. As of July 4th 2024, Hitachi's voice is derived from Yuzuki Yukari V4.

**Vocal Data Information:**

With his new voice being Yuzuki Yukari's V4, Hitachi's "voicebanks" are derived from Onn, Lin and Jun. With XSY settings in VOCALOID4, Hitachi's "voicebanks" are:

* **STRAIGHT**: A "voicebank" that is a mix of Yukari's V4 Jun and Onn voicebanks using XSY settings. Jun is the primary vocals, while Onn is secondary.
* **STRONG**: A "voicebank" that is a mix of Yukari's V4 Lin and Onn voicebanks using XSY settings. Lin is the primary vocals, while Onn is secondary.
* **SOFT**: A "voicebank" that is a mix of Yukari's V4 Onn and Jun voicebanks using XSY settings. Onn is the primary vocals, while Jun is secondary.
* **DARK**: A "voicebank" that is a mix of Yukari's V4 Onn and Lin voicebanks using XSY settings. Onn is the primary vocals, while Lin is secondary.

Disclaimer:

Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
