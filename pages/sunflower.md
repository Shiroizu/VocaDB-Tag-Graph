#Themes

> The common names "_sunflower_" and "_common sunflower_" typically refer to the popular annual species Helianthus annuus, whose round flower heads in combination with the ligules look like the sun. This and other species are cultivated in temperate regions and some tropical regions as food crops for humans, cattle, and poultry, and as ornamental plants. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helianthus))

Common meanings in floriography ([Flower Meaning](https://www.flowermeaning.com/sunflower-meaning/)):
* long life, mainly since most varieties stand in full bloom for months on end during the hottest days of summer;
* feelings of adoration, admiration, and platonic love towards a person, such as a family member or friend;
* loyalty and strong bonds between two people, as represented by the strong and upright stem;
* seeking out positivity and strength, as the bloom turns to face the sun;
* nourishing yourself and others, since the sunflower produces an abundance of edible seeds;
* brightening your mood, through the vibrancy of the yellow or orange petals;
* good luck and lasting happiness, especially in the Chinese culture;
* respect, passionate love, radiance ([hanakotoba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanakotoba)).
