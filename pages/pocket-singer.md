#Vocalists

A singing synthesis app by ACCIDENTAL AI PTE. LTD and released on February 15th, 2023. Similar in nature to [MYCOEIROINK](https://vocadb.net/T/9684/mycoeiroink), Pocket Singer is something of a "make-your-own" spin-off version of ACE Virtual Singer. By combining preset vocal styles, users are able to create their own specialized AI vocalists that can sing in either English, Japanese, or Chinese. The program also allows for people to make 3D avatars for their singers.

Note1: Since each vocalist is created through a mixture of built-in presets, it *is* technically possible for users to stumble upon the same combination as someone else, thus allowing for duplicate vocals across the program. However, since there is no real way to track this, vocalists for this program should be handled similarly to UTAU with each character being treated as a separate creation. 

Note2: Due to the nature of this program, all vocalists are de facto private.

Note3: Unnamed presets use the [Pocket Singer (Unknown)](https://vocadb.net/Ar/125022) artist.
