>Geisha, also known as geiko or geigi, are a class of female Japanese performing artists and entertainers trained in traditional Japanese performing arts styles, such as dance, music and singing, as well as being proficient conversationalists and hosts.
Their distinct appearance is characterised by long, trailing kimono, traditional hairstyles and oshiroi make-up.
Geisha entertain at parties known as ozashiki, often for the entertainment of wealthy clientele, as well as performing on stage and at festivals.
