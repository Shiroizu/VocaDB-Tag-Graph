#Themes

Punk fashion came out of the general punk subculture that [punk rock](https://vocadb.net/T/480/punk-rock) itself originated in. It takes inspiration from militaristic, gothic, and even BDSM fashion, incorporating dark colours, heavy chains, and plenty of rips into a single look. The illustration, drawn by [nekomeguri](https://vocadb.net/Ar/70170), depicts [Miku](https://vocadb.net/Ar/1) in a punk outfit; note the skull iconography, the spiked collar, the crop top, and even the fierce expression.
