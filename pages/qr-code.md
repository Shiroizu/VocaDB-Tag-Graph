#Sources

> A QR code (an initialism for quick response code) is a type of matrix barcode (or two-dimensional barcode) invented in 1994 by the Japanese automotive company Denso Wave.
A barcode is a machine-readable optical label that can contain information about the item to which it is attached.
In practice, QR codes often contain data for a locator, identifier, or tracker that points to a website or application.
QR codes use four standardized encoding modes (numeric, alphanumeric, byte/binary, and kanji) to store data efficiently; extensions may also be used.
