From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_(musician))

> Sophie Xeon (/ˈziːɒn/; 17 September 1986 – 30 January 2021), known mononymously as SOPHIE (stylized in all caps), was an English music producer, songwriter, and DJ. Her work is known for its brash take on pop music and is distinguished by experimental sound design, "sugary" synthesized textures, and incorporation of underground dance styles. She would help pioneer the 2010s hyperpop microgenre.
