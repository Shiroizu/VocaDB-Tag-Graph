#Editor_notes

From Google Dictionary: 

> "Sic" is used in brackets after a copied or quoted word that appears odd or erroneous to show that the word is quoted exactly as it stands in the original.

This differs from the ["mistype"](https://vocadb.net/T/273/mistype) tag in that mistypes are always unintentional, while sic can be used for ambiguous cases.

It is unnecessary to add a corrected title (unlike the mistype tag) because these titles might not necessarily be incorrect.
