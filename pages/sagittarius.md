>Sagittarius (♐︎/♐) is the ninth astrological sign, which is associated with the constellation Sagittarius and spans 240–270th degrees of the zodiac.
Under the tropical zodiac, the sun transits this sign between approximately November 22 and December 21.
Greek mythology associates Sagittarius with the centaur Chiron, who mentored Achilles, a Greek hero of the Trojan War, in archery.
Sagittarius, the half human and half horse, is the centaur of mythology, the learned healer whose higher intelligence forms a bridge between Earth and Heaven.
Also known as the Archer, Sagittarius is represented by the symbol of a bow and arrow.
