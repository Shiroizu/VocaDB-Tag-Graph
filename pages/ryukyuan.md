#Languages

The Japonic languages spoken natively in Okinawa (the former Ryukyu Kingdom), treated in mainstream Japanese society as dialects of Japanese.
Okinawan is classified under Ryukyuan.

> The Ryukyuan languages of Okinawa Prefecture and the southern islands of Kagoshima Prefecture form a separate branch of the Japonic family, and are not Japanese dialects, although they are sometimes referred to as such.
