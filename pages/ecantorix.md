#Vocalists

eCantorix is a Linux based singing synthesis frontend for eSpeak. It works by using eSpeak to generate raw speech samples, then adjusting their pitch and length and finally creating a LMMS project file referencing the samples in sync to the input file. eCantorix also supports MBROLA voices.
