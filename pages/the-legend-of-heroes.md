>The Legend of Heroes, known in Japan as Eiyū Densetsu, is a series of role-playing video games developed by Nihon Falcom.
First starting as a part of the Dragon Slayer series in the late 1980s, the series evolved into its own decade-spanning, interconnected series with fourteen entries, including several subseries.
All games in the franchise released since 2004 are part of the Trails subseries, known as Kiseki (軌跡) in Japan.
The most recent entry, The Legend of Heroes: Kuro no Kiseki, was released in 2021.
