#Themes

> A Japanese cooking technique in which various foods—most often chicken, but also other meat and fish—are deep fried in oil.
The process involves lightly coating small pieces of the meat or fish with a combination of flour and potato starch or corn starch, and frying in a light oil.
The foods are marinated prior to coating. The process differs from the preparation of tempura, which is not marinated and uses a batter for coating.
Karaage is often served alone or with rice and shredded cabbage.
