#Event

A promotional campaign between Hatsune Miku and the energy drink brand "POCARI SWEAT"

In December 20, 2019 Hatsune Miku (in her Project SEKAI model) was chosen as the POCARI SWEAT ambassador as part of Otsuka Pharmaceutical and beyond2020 cultural program to help people survive the summer in Japan and prevent heatstrokes during the major sports events in 2020. Virtual singers Hatsune Miku and MEIKO, alongside Hoshino Ichika from Project SEKAI, and popular VTubers Mirai Akari (ミライアカリ), YuNi and Fuji Aoi (富士葵) will be sharing information and special songs to show the importance of staying hydrated and the benefits of POCARI.

In 2021, the other members of Leo/need (Tenma Saki, Mochizuki Honami, Hinomori Shiho and Megurine Luka) from Project SEKAI joined the campaign.
