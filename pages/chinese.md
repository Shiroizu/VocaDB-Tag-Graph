#Languages

- Umbrella tag for all languages that belong to the Sinitic or Chinese language family

___

> The **Sinitic languages** (漢語族/汉语族), often synonymous with "**Chinese languages**", are a group of East Asian analytic languages that constitute the major branch of the **Sino-Tibetan language** family.
It is frequently proposed that there is a primary split between the **Sinitic languages** and the rest of the family (the **Tibeto-Burman languages**).
This view is rejected by a number of researchers but has found phylogenetic support among others.
The Greater **Bai languages**, whose classification is difficult, may be an offshoot of **Old Chinese** and thus **Sinitic**; otherwise **Sinitic** is defined only by the many varieties of **Chinese** unified by a shared historical background, and usage of the term "**Sinitic**" may reflect the linguistic view that **Chinese** constitutes a family of distinct languages, rather than variants of a single language.
