#Editor_notes

Use this when the song video is already published on YouTube but, at the moment of adding the tag, has yet to premiere. As soon as the premiere has aired the embed must be re-added with correct metadata, after that the tag needs to be removed.

__â€»Note that songs that do not have any other media except for the upcoming YouTube premiere are not allowed to be added to the database until after the premiere (i.e. after the video is made public and can be viewed).__
