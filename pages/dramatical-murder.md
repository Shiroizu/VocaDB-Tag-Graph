It was originally released on March 23, 2012 for Windows PCs as a first press edition, with a regular edition released on April 27, 2012. A sequel titled Dramatical Murder re:connect, also for Windows PCs, was released on April 26, 2013, adding additional scenes, images and songs to the existing routes, as well as four new character routes to play through.
