#Derivative

For songs or albums that explicitly define the use of the derivative, **Megurine Luki**.

Luki, sometimes called Luke, is a derived voice configuration for the VOCALOID [Megurine Luka](http://vocadb.net/Ar/2) in which the original voicebank's tone is adjusted significantly. There is no defined configuration for this derivative - he is sometimes pitched up or pitched down.

Luki was illustrated by Kojimakako, according to the Fanloid Wiki.

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
