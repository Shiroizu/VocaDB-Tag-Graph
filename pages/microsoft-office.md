From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office):
>Microsoft Office, or simply Office, is a discontinued family of client software, server software, and services developed by Microsoft.
It was first announced by Bill Gates on August 1, 1988, at COMDEX in Las Vegas.
Initially a marketing term for an office suite (bundled set of productivity applications), the first version of Office contained Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint.
Over the years, Office applications have grown substantially closer with shared features such as a common spell checker, Object Linking and Embedding data integration and Visual Basic for Applications scripting language.
Microsoft also positions Office as a development platform for line-of-business software under the Office Business Applications brand.
It contains a word processor (Word), a spreadsheet program (Excel) and a presentation program (PowerPoint), an email client (Outlook), a database management system (Access), and a desktop publishing app (Publisher).
(...)
In October 2022, Microsoft announced that it will phase out the Microsoft Office brand in favor of "Microsoft 365" by January 2023.
The name will continue to be used for legacy product offerings.
