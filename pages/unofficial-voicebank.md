#Sources

This tag is for Jinriki voicebanks (artist entries) and songs entries featuring Jinriki voicebanks (as custom artists).

Jinriki Vocaloid (人力ボーカロイド, lit. "Manual Vocaloid") is a common practice in Nico Nico Douga targeting Vocaloids, and involves re-editing an existing singing voice (especially a singer or anime character), extracting tones as WAV files and reassembling them. It is different from the popular singing synthesizer Vocaloid. (*Info from the* [*Niconico Wiki.*](https://niconicodouga.fandom.com/wiki/Jinriki_Vocaloid))

While many of these videos do not use existing vocal engines, a subtype called UTAU-shiki Jinriki (UTAU式人力, lit. "UTAU-Type Manual") involves the creation and usage of private UTAU voicebanks.

Artist entries for unofficial voicebanks generated from existing singing voices (Jinriki) without consent **are not allowed**. For songs that feature these, the credits should be done through the "custom artist" feature along with this tag.
