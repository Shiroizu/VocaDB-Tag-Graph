#Genres

Baggy is a genre associated with the Madchester scene that mixes dance and funk grooves with indie rock-driven guitar and jangly sounds, also drawing influence from psychedelic sounds.

The name comes from the scene's fashion, which featured baggy jeans and brightly coloured tops, a throwback to the 1960s.
