i-dle (Korean: 아이들), formerly (G)I-dle (Korean: (여자)아이들; RR: Yeoja Aideul), stylized in all caps, is a South Korean girl group formed by Cube Entertainment in 2018. The group consists of five members: Miyeon, Minnie, Soyeon, Yuqi, and Shuhua. Originally a six-piece, Soojin departed from the group on August 14, 2021. The group debuted on May 2, 2018, with the single "Latata" from their first extended play I Am. On July 31, 2019, the group debuted in Japan under U-Cube with Latata.

In 2018, the group was dubbed the "monster rookies" of the year and have been considered one of the most successful South Korean girl groups that do not hail from the "big three" record labels. Since their debut, the group has released six extended plays and eight singles, which include: "Latata", "Hann (Alone)", "Senorita", "Uh-Oh", "Lion", "Oh My God", "Dumdi Dumdi" and "Hwaa".
