#Themes

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocky):

>Pocky is a snack food produced by Ezaki Glico. Pocky was first sold in 1966, and were invented by Yoshiaki Koma. They consist of chocolate-coated biscuit sticks. It was named after the Japanese onomatopoetic word *pokkin* (ポッキン).

>The original was followed by an almond coating in 1971, and a strawberry coating in 1977. Today, the product line includes variations such as milk, mousse, green tea, honey, banana, cookies and cream, and coconut flavored coatings, and themed products such as "Decorer Pocky", with colorful decorative stripes in the coating, and "Men's Pocky", a dark (bittersweet) chocolate and "mature" version.
