#Vocalists

Realivox - Ladies is focused on only short [sounds and articulations](https://vocadb.net/T/310/no-lyrics). While [Blue](https://vocadb.net/Ar/32631) can easily speak English words, the voicebanks in Ladies are designed to sing in vocables instead. Originally called ["RealiVox Vocal Palette"](https://web.archive.org/web/20120228213421/http://realitone.com/), Ladies has been through quite a few changes over the years. It was first released on [December 15th, 2012](https://vi-control.net/community/threads/product-version-history.109968/), and was rereleased in its 2.0 version on [April 18th, 2015](https://vi-control.net/community/threads/product-version-history.109968/).

There are five Ladies voicebanks: [Cheryl](https://vocadb.net/Ar/115111), [Julie](https://vocadb.net/Ar/115110), [Patty](https://vocadb.net/Ar/115109), [Teresa](https://vocadb.net/Ar/115112), and [Toni](https://vocadb.net/Ar/115108). The girls can either be bought together in the Complete Ladies package, or in a four-bank (Cheryl, Julie, Patty, and Toni) Lite pack. Teresa is the only bank that can be bought on her own.
