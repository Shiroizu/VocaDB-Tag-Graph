#Series

As the title suggests, an association of older Vocaloid producers.

Emerged after a series of comic strips by [Dancing Cloud](https://vocadb.net/Ar/94493) somewhere during the [VocaColle 2022 Autumn](https://vocadb.net/E/4374). The author, aged 50, commented in their Note post how they thought their generation was less involved in the Vocaloid scene, and how untrue that turned out to be.

※One of the recommendations for the union members is to "_view the young newcomers as rivals_".
