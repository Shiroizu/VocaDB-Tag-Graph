#Editor_notes

Use this tag for entries whose **titles** have gikun or jukujikun readings.
These are typically provided along with the title itself, in the PV, or in the description. 
Example:
[[1]](https://vocadb.net/S/38389): Tsukiakari is provided as a gikun reading.

> Gikun are other readings assigned to a character instead of its standard readings. Some of these, such as for tabako (煙草), have become lexicalized, but in many cases this kind of use is typically non-standard and employed in specific contexts by individual writers. Aided with furigana, gikun could be used to convey complex literary or poetic effect (especially if the readings contradict the kanji), or clarification if the referent may not be obvious.
