#Genres

Progressive rock is a subgenre of rock characterized by extended length (often 20 to 40 minutes), unconventional melody patterns and multiple, rapid changes of tempo.

> Progressive rock is a rock music subgenre that originated in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. It developed from psychedelic rock, and began as an attempt to give greater artistic weight and credibility to rock music. Songs were replaced by musical suites that often stretched to 20 or 40 minutes in length and contained symphonic influences, extended musical themes, fantasy-like ambience and lyrics, and complex orchestrations.
