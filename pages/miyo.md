#Animation

Miyo is one of the two mascots for the [Miyo DiffSinger](https://vocadb.net/Ar/136863) voicebank, alongside [Xiao Meihua](https://vocadb.net/T/11431). The voicebank (and any subsequent AI-type voicebanks) was originally created solely for Miyo, but was later decided to have Xiao Meihua serve as an optional representative character.

This tag is to be used for artwork, such as in PVs or illustrations, featuring Miyo.
