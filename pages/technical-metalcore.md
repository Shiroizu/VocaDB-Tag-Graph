#Genres

>*--Progressive metalcore (also called technical metalcore or ambient metalcore) is a fusion of progressive metal and metalcore characterized by highly technical lead guitar, "atmospheric" elements, and complex instrumentation. Some notable practitioners take influence from djent.

>*--from Wikipedia*

Wikipedia considers "progressive metalcore" and "technical metalcore" synonyms, but a small distinction can be made. Progressive metalcore challenges typical song conventions. Technical metalcore challenges players with its instrumental difficulty.

**Technical metalcore** is a form of metalcore that demands very high levels of instrumental skill and often very high speeds. Characteristics for this form of metalcore include, but do not limit to, highly technical guitars and bass (and often that of drums), extremely high tempos, complex notation patterns, highly technical lead guitars, and rapid successions of notes that are often not found in metalcore or other genres. This form of metalcore can be in 4/4 or any variety of time signatures.

Most notable example of tech-metalcore is Threat Signal's *Disconnect*, which the link is available on this page.
