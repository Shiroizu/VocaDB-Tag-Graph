#Languages

English Wikipedia:
> Mojibake is the garbled text that is the result of text being decoded using an unintended character encoding. The result is a systematic replacement of symbols with completely unrelated ones, often from a different writing system.

The kanji `縺` `繝` `繧` are notoriously characteristic of Japanese mojibake.
