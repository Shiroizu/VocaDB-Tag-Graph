> Akihabara is a common name for the area around Akihabara Station in the Chiyoda ward of Tokyo, Japan.
The name Akihabara is a shortening of Akibagahara (秋葉ヶ原), which ultimately comes from Akiba (秋葉), named after a fire-controlling deity of a firefighting shrine built after the area was destroyed by a fire in 1869.
Currently, Akihabara is considered by many to be an otaku cultural center and a shopping district for video games, anime, manga, and computer goods.
Icons from popular anime and manga are displayed prominently on the shops in the area, and numerous maid cafés are found throughout the district.
