#Genres

>Contemporary folk music refers to a wide variety of genres that emerged in the mid 20th century and afterwards which were associated with traditional folk music. Starting in the mid-20th century a new form of popular folk music evolved from traditional folk music. This process and period is called the (second) folk revival and reached a zenith in the 1960s. The most common name for this new form of music is also "folk music", but is often called "contemporary folk music" or "folk revival music" to make the distinction. (from Wikipedia)

The Japanese term フォークソング (folk song) is used for the [contemporary folk -genre](https://vocadb.net/T/6379/contemporary-folk).

The art is by [Yukimitsu](https://vocadb.net/Ar/85751). It depicts [Oliver](https://vocadb.net/Ar/383) gently holding an acoustic guitar. His goldfinch, James, rests upon it.
