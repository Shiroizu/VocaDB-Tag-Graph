#Derivative

Rinko (seen as either "RINKO" in all caps or "琳子") is a derivation of Otomachi Una, a Vocaloid published and distributed by Internet Co., Ltd.. She was created in February 2016, by producer [kousaku-P (工作P)](https://vocadb.net/Ar/44848) and illustrator [Ei-Flow](https://vocadb.net/Ar/46290), being heavily inspired by Sena Kashiwazaki from Boku Wa Tomodachi Ga Sukunai and Umaru Doma from Himouto! Umaru-chan, but also dragging inspiration from many other medias as well. Her name comes from a play of words, with 琳 (rin) meaning "beautiful jade, gem" and 子 (ko) meaning "child".

She has two designs, one for "Spicy" and other for "Sugar"

Rinko is a pitchloid of Una, sounding more mature due to the pitching down of the base voicebank.
