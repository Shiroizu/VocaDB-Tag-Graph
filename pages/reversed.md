#Sources

For songs where some part is played in reverse/backwards (either entirely or only parts).

> Backmasking is a recording technique in which a message is recorded backward onto a track that is meant to be played forward.
It is a deliberate process, whereas a message found through phonetic reversal may be unintentional.
