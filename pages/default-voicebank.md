#Vocalists

A "default voicebank" refers to the voicebank that a program automatically uses if no characters are set. For example, the ironically-named ["No Default Voice"](https://vocadb.net/Ar/114520) is what [Synthesizer-V](https://vocadb.net/T/6745/synthesizer-v) will default to; similarly, [Vocalwriter](https://vocadb.net/T/7180/vocalwriter) launches with all of its voices, but it will pull up [Robert](https://vocadb.net/Ar/113410) if nothing else is done.

Please note that not all programs have a default voicebank. For instance, [VOICEVOX](https://vocadb.net/T/8533) requires the user to pick out a character before any sounds can be input, negating any need for for a bank on back-up duty.

Icon by [oyama](hhttps://vocadb.net/Ar/104343). It depicts [Uta Utane](https://piapro.jp/isona), alternatively known as "Defoko" or even "Default", as she stares melancholically at the audience. Her nicknames are derived from the fact that she's the default vocal for the program, UTAU.
