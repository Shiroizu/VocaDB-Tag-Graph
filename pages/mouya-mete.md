#Derivative

Mouya Mete is a fan character derived from [Hatsune Miku](https://vocadb.net/Ar/1). She was created by X-LOID (xai3939) with the help of Flowrish in December 2007 as a response to the legal controversy between Dwango and Crypton that occurred that month. She represents the desire to end drama in the Vocaloid community.

She is the counterpart of Yamine Aku, who was created by the same user during the same event.
