#Sources

Songs **unofficially** created to follow up another song by a **different** producer. For songs created by the same producer, please use the [sequel song](https://vocadb.net/T/8117/sequel-song) tag.

An answer song is a song written as a response to an earlier song, differing from a sequel song in that it is written or performed by a different artist, making them unofficial, or fan-made.

When applying this tag please be sure to mention the original song is some format, preferably in the external links or in the description.
