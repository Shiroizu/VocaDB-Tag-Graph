#Themes

**Mizuiro** (水色, lit. "light blue") is a colorway, style, and aesthetic that predominantly combines light blue/aqua with white and gray colors, oversized clothing (often jerseys/tracksuits), cyber themes, and otaku/gamer themes.

**Tenshi kaiwai** (天使界隈, lit. "angelic community") and **mizuiro kaiwai** (水色界隈, lit. "light blue community") are promotional hashtags for the magazine [tenshi_zyoshi](https://www.instagram.com/tenshi_zyoshi) (on Instagram).

There's also a style called **jersey maid** (ジャージメイド), which combines tracksuits with maid attributes, lace, frills etc. Entries that fall under jersey maid can also be tagged.

Art is by [**あらめ**](https://piapro.jp/aramedraw).
