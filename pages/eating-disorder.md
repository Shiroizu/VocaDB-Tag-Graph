#Themes

A mental disorder defined by abnormal eating habits that negatively affect a person's physical and/or mental health. They include:

- binge eating disorder, where people eat a large amount in a short period of time
- anorexia nervosa, where people eat very little due to a fear of gaining weight and thus have a low body weight
- bulimia nervosa, where people eat a lot and then try to rid themselves of the food
- pica, where people eat non-food items
- rumination syndrome, where people regurgitate food
- avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), where people have a reduced or selective food intake due to some psychological reasons
