#Vocalists

Similar to [VOCALO CHANGER](https://vocadb.net/T/9170/vocalo-changer), it allows Diff-SVC voicebanks to read the inputted audio file in any language, regardless of what language the voicebank was recorded in.

Avoided tagging a song with "unsupported language" and use this when it clearly states that a Diff-SVC model is being used.
