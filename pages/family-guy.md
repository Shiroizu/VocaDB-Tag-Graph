>Family Guy is an American adult animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane and developed by MacFarlane and David Zuckerman for the Fox Broadcasting Company that premiered on January 31, 1999. The series is produced by Fuzzy Door Productions. The series centers on the Griffins, a family consisting of parents Peter and Lois; their children, Meg, Chris, and Stewie; and their anthropomorphic pet dog, Brian. The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, and exhibits much of its humor in the form of metafictional cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture.
