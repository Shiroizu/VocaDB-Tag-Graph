#Derivative

Kowaretane Zen is a FANLOID of VOCALOID [Kagamine Len](https://vocadb.net/Ar/15). He was created by Joyokii in March 2012.
Zen is one of several yandere versions of Kagamine Len. Zen is self-confident and dominant, friendly only to a select few. He doesn't let anyone near Zin because he is extremely overprotective, but he is very affectionate with those he trusts.

Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku
