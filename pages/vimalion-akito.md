#Animation

Design for the Vocaloid [AKITO](https://vocadb.net/Ar/110054) created by the group [VIMALION PROJECT](https://vocadb.net/Ar/110180).

Illustration by [rice](https://vocadb.net/Ar/69939) from the [VIMALION website](https://vimalion.pro/).

> As steadfast and stubborn as a rock, you get the sense that you could argue with him for months before he'd even think of compromising on his ideals.
