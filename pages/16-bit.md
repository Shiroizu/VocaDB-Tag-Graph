#Genres

16-bit refers to the amount of "bits" machines could compute; 16-bit processors became especially prevalent during the fourth [gaming generation](https://vocadb.net/T/6195/video-game). Due to the hardware's nature, games were forced to contain [pixel art](https://vocadb.net/T/338/pixel-art) and [chiptune music](https://vocadb.net/T/62/chiptune) creating an iconic aesthetic that's still replicated to this day. Notably, 16-bit processors allowed for a wider gradiation of colour and far more audio depth than the previous [8-bit](https://vocadb.net/T/5/8-bit) machines.

かすてぃら's [Rana](https://vocadb.net/Ar/41936) illustration is an example of 16-bit-inspired pixel art; note the slightly blocky nature and somewhat limited colour scheme.
