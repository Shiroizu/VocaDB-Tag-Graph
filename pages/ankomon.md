#Derivative

Ankomon is an official derivative of Zundamon that debuted in a crossover campaign with the game Onigiri. Its initial appearance was as an enemy type described as a "fake Zundamon", but with little backstory.

Once Zundamon's human form debuted and became popular, people started to make fan designs and lore for Ankomon as a rival character. In response, her official human design was posted in May 2024.

While Zundamon is based on zunda-mochi, Ankomon is based on anko-mochi. This has also inspired various fan derivatives based on different types of mochi.
