>Capricorn (♑︎/♑) is the tenth astrological sign in the zodiac out of twelve total zodiac signs, originating from the constellation of Capricornus, the goat.
It spans the 270–300th degree of the zodiac, corresponding to celestial longitude.
Under the tropical zodiac, the sun transits this area from about December 22 to January 19.
In astrology, Capricorn is considered an earth sign, negative sign, and one of the four cardinal signs.
Capricorn is said to be ruled by the planet Saturn.
There appears to be a connection between traditional characterizations of Capricorn as a sea goat and the Sumerian god of wisdom and waters, who also had the head and upper body of a goat and the lower body and tail of a fish.
Later known as Ea in Akkadian and Babylonian mythology, Enki was the god of intelligence (gestú, literally "ear"), creation, crafts; magic; water, seawater and lake water (a, aba, ab).
