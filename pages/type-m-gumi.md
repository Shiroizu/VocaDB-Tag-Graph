#Derivative

Type-M Gumi is a Punk Rock version of Vocaloid Gumi. Her surname has not been revealed and the fandom may likely refer to her as the collective name 鋼音 (Hagane) due to origin of the series type. She is drawn by Momopanda and thus does not have an Type-H counterpart by Hansi.

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
