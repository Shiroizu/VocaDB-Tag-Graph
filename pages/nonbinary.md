#Themes

Nonbinary is an open-ended umbrella term for gender identities that are not purely male or female (the "binary"). Nonbinary people may have no gender (agender), have a fluctuating gender (genderfluid and its sub-identities), have multiple genders (bigender, trigender, etc.), or something else completely. Note that most nonbinary people in real life are [transgender](https://vocadb.net/T/7343/transgender), though cis nonbinary people do also exist. 

Not to be confused with [neutral vocal range](https://vocadb.net/T/4722/neutral-vocal-range): this tag is for characters who are canonically nonbinary, while that tag is for voicebanks with an androgynous tone. For instance, [Saros](https://vocadb.net/Ar/118795) is canonically nonbinary with a significant [masculine vocal range](https://vocadb.net/T/4673), while [v Flower](https://vocadb.net/Ar/21165) is canonically female but also has a [neutral vocal range](https://vocadb.net/T/3358).

This tag may be used for:
* Songs and albums about nonbinary identities, issues, or ideas
* Songs and albums that prominently feature a nonbinary character(s)
* Artists who often work with the above
* Canonically nonbinary characters
