#Themes

From [Wikipedia's psychedelic art article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_art):
>Psychedelic art is any art or visual displays inspired by psychedelic experiences and hallucinations known to follow the ingestion of psychoactive drugs such as LSD and psilocybin. The word "psychedelic" (coined by British psychologist Humphry Osmond) means "mind manifesting". By that definition, all artistic efforts to depict the inner world of the psyche may be considered "psychedelic".

This tag applies to:

* PVs/Songs with illustrations that have psychedelic art
* Artists producing songs/PVs with these themes

The illustration is by [ぱつ](https://vocadb.net/Ar/54628). It represents the psychedelic art side of things, what with its clashing patterns and saturated neons.
