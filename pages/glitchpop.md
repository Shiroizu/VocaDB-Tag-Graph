#Genres

>Glitch Pop is a genre mostly based on the roots of experimental Electronic elements and modern Pop. Productions following the style incorporate the concrete/abstract sounds from Glitch and IDM to a pop songwriting format, mostly related with Synthpop, Art Pop and Indietronica (and on more recent cases Alternative R&B). Some of the newer glitch pop productions lack the experimental techniques of the original scene to allow a more commercial sound but still follow with the simple definition of its glitchy-sounding format.
