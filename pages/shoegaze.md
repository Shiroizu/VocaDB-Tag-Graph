#Genres

Shoegaze is a style of indie and alternative rock that focuses on creating ethereal, noisy washes of sound, with bands utilizing various effect pedals, such as distortion, reverb, and delay. The guitars often reach overwhelming volumes, making the lyrics unintelligible and mainly applying vocals as another melodic layer. The genre's name comes from the heavy use of effects pedals, as the performers were often looking down at their pedals during concerts.
