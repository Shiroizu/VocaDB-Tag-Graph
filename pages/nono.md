#Derivative

**Nono** is a derivative of [Momone Momo](https://vocadb.net/Ar/598) created by the band [TOBEFOOPERS](https://vocadb.net/Ar/59065) in April of 2025. She was replaced as a alternate name due to a conflict with Momo's name within the band, except still using her original filename (being "momone voice library".)
