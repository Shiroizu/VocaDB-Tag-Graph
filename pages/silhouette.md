#Animation

A "silhouette" is a solid-colour image of a character that depicts only their shape. Silhouettes are internally featureless, only showcasing the outer most of a character's design. A silhouette may differentiate between a character's clothes and skin through different colours, or perhaps represent a few accessories.

This tag is for song videos and album covers depicting characters in silhouette.
