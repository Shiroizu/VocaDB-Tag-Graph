___

> Miku Flick/02 (ミクフリック/02) was a 2012 rhythm game created by Sega and Crypton Future Media for the iOS operating systems iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch.
The game was a sequel to Miku Flick, released earlier that year, and a spin off of the Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA series of Vocaloid rhythm games.
Like the original, the game primarily makes use of Vocaloids, a series of singing synthesizer software, and the songs created using these vocaloids, most notably the virtual-diva Vocaloid Hatsune Miku.
The game was released internationally on August 10, 2012, making it the second Project Diva game to be released in English.

> Support for the game ended on July 19, 2016.
