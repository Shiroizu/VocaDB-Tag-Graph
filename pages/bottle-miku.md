#Animation

>Originally created by PAR。of Pixiv, Bottle Miku was conceptualized as a surrealist interpretation of Miku's character with her hair depicted as water. Her outfit is a white sailor fuku with a black collar and crimson red or pink lines and a black, pleated skirt. The most prominent feature in her design is her hair which is made of water with several red/orange fishes swimming inside of it (usually carps, goldfishes or kois). Along with her original Vocaloid counterpart, Bottle Miku's hair is tied in twintails with black ribbons with a crimson line in the center, matching the details of her uniform.
