#Sources

A self-cover is when an artist [covers](http://vocadb.net/T/74/cover) their own song, thus meaning that both the original and derived (cover) versions are made by the same producer. Self-covers use the "cover" song type, unless they're also a remix or a mashup, in which case they use one of those types. Note that sometimes self-covers are referred to as "original songs".

Voice synth songs entries for songs that include a voice synth version and a human-sung version (both official) should be tagged with [simultaneous upload](https://vocadb.net/T/4946/simultaneous-upload) instead, if the song publish dates are **less than a week apart**. 


This tag may be used for:
* self-covered songs
* albums predominantly made up of self-covers
