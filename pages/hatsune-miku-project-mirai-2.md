___

> Hatsune Miku: Project Mirai 2 (初音ミク Project mirai 2) is a rhythm game created by Sega and Crypton Future Media for the Nintendo 3DS and the sequel to Hatsune Miku and Future Stars: Project Mirai.
The game is also a spin-off of the Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA series of Vocaloid rhythm games and was first released on November 28, 2013 in Japan with no international release until September 2015.
Like the original, the game primarily makes use of Vocaloids, a series of singing synthesizer software and the songs created using these vocaloids most notably the virtual-diva Vocaloid Hatsune Miku.
It is also the second game to include a Vocaloid made by Internet Co., Ltd., Gumi.
An updated version of the game was released in 2015, first in Japan as Hatsune Miku: Project Mirai Deluxe (初音ミク Project mirai でらっくす), then in North America and Europe under the title of Hatsune Miku: Project Mirai DX.
