#Derivative

Honey Lily is a derivative of Lily modeled after a honeybee. She originated from a design portraying Lily as a bee created by [Yukke Hayashi](https://vocadb.net/Ar/9744). She is often portrayed holding a spear or pitchfork and, despite having no official voice configuration, she is sometimes given a higher pitched version of Lily's voice.
