#Themes

A café is a restaurant focused on selling and serving warm [drinks](https://vocadb.net/T/6899/drink), such as [tea](https://vocadb.net/T/6548/tea), [hot chocolate](https://vocadb.net/T/8401/hot-chocolate), [steamed milk](https://vocadb.net/T/6900/milk), and especially [coffee](https://vocadb.net/T/6194/coffee). Many cafés also serve baked goods of various types, both sweet and savoury. Maid cafés are a particular café sub-variety where the waitresses (and occasionally waiters) dress up as maids and treat the customers as if they're the masters of a private home instead of patrons at a restaurant.

["Café music"](https://vocadb.net/T/1631/cafe-music) is the tag for the related atmospheric music genre.
