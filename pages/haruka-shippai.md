#Derivative

The masculine and or "genderbent" version of [Ken Shippai](https://vocadb.net/Ar/51791). Originally, he was a masculine counterpart as a completely separate character. Ken is a shapeshifter, and can shift her form at will. During points of experimentation or in need, she transforms into a masculine exterior, labeling herself "Haruka", a borderline separate entity.

Haruka's voice is derived from [Ken Shippai](https://vocadb.net/Ar/51791), set with the flags Y0H0B0c99g+15.

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
