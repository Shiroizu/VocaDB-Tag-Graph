#Series

A "song series" is a set of interconnected songs, many (but not all) of which form a greater story. Some famous series within the Vocaloid community include [mothy's](https://vocadb.net/Ar/189) [The Evillious Chronicles](https://vocadb.net/T/6982), [Jin's](https://vocadb.net/Ar/552) [Kagerou Project](https://vocadb.net/T/220), and [samfree's](https://vocadb.net/Ar/52) [Night series](https://vocadb.net/T/386/samfree-night-series).
