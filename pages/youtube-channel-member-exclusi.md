#Distribution

Tag for videos that are exclusive to paid members of a YouTube channel.

> Channel memberships let viewers join your channel through monthly payments and get exclusive members-only perks in return like badges, emoji and other goods.

> Members-only Shorts can be a great way to provide regular, lightweight content for your channel members. You can share short behind-the-scenes content, clips of upcoming videos, short Q&As and more. Since these Shorts can only be viewed by members, you can experiment with content that's more casual or natural/organic, compared to your public content.

> The Members-only videos feature lets you upload videos that only your channel members can watch. You can also change the visibility settings of existing videos so that they're exclusive to your members. Anyone can find a members-only video but only members at the right levels can watch it.
