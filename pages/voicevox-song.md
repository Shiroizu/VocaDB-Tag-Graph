#Vocalists

**[VOICEVOX](https://vocadb.net/T/8533) Song stands for voicebanks that can sing using the [Humming](https://vocadb.net/T/10262) function**, which released officially on April 27th, 2024 following multiple beta releases from January 31st, 2024 onward, **with a specific singing dataset.** 

As of its first beta, [Namine Ritsu](https://vocadb.net/Ar/98816) is the only voicebank to support both Humming (by use of its text-to-speech recordings) and Song (by use of its sung recordings).
