#Themes

>**Classical elements** typically refer to **earth**, **water**, **air**, **fire**, and (later) **aether** which were proposed to explain the nature and complexity of all matter in terms of simpler substances.
Ancient cultures in **Greece**, **Tibet**, and **India** had similar lists which sometimes referred, in local languages, to "**air**" as "**wind**" and the fifth element as "**void**".

>These different cultures and even individual philosophers had widely varying explanations concerning their attributes and how they related to **observable phenomena** as well as **cosmology**.
Sometimes these theories overlapped with **mythology** and were **personified in deities**.
Some of these interpretations included **atomism** (the idea of very small, indivisible portions of matter), but other interpretations considered the elements to be **divisible into infinitely small pieces** without changing their nature.

>While the classification of the material world in **ancient Indian**, **Hellenistic Egypt**, and **ancient Greece** into **Air**, **Earth**, **Fire** and **Water** was more **philosophical**, during the **Middle Ages** medieval scientists used practical, experimental observation to classify materials.
In **Europe**, the **Ancient Greek** concept, devised by **Empedocles**, evolved into the system of **Aristotle** and **Hippocrates**, who introduced systematic classification into the area, which evolved slightly into the medieval system, which for the first time in **Europe** became subject to experimental verification in the **1600s**, during the Scientific Revolution.

> - **Godai** are the five elements in **Japanese Buddhist** thought of **earth** (chi), **water** (sui), **fire** (ka), **wind** (fu), and **void** (ku).
> - **Wuxing**, usually translated as **Five Phases** or **Five Agents**, is a **fivefold conceptual scheme** from **China** consisting of **Fire** (火; huǒ), **Water** (水; shuǐ), **Wood** (木; mù), **Metal** or **Gold** (金; jīn), and **Earth** or **Soil** (土; tǔ).

>Modern science does not support the classical elements as the material basis of the physical world.
