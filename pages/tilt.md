#Animation

TILT is a Pop'n Music fan character created by [BEMANI](https://vocadb.net/T/9330/bemani) composer [Chilt](https://vocadb.net/Ar/65640), who is related somewhat to [ALT](https://vocadb.net/T/9328/alt) design and concept-wise.
Voiced by AquesTone's [Female_F1](https://vocadb.net/Ar/91696) voice (thus making her an image character for AquesTone), this A.I. gal is a friendly rival of ALT.

This tag is for songs or albums where TILT appears.
