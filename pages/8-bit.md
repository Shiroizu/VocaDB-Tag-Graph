#Genres

8-bit refers to a particular amount of "bits" a machine could process; these machines were especially common in the third [video game generation](https://vocadb.net/T/6195/video-game). Due to hardware limitations, games were forced to contain [chiptune music](https://vocadb.net/T/62/chiptune) and [pixelated illustrations](https://vocadb.net/T/338/pixel-art). 8-bit systems have a very distinctive, limited nature, creating a cohesive style that many people have replicated.

___
永久力吹雪's [Miku](https://vocadb.net/Ar/1) art is explicitly modeled after the [Gameboy's](https://vocadb.net/T/166) particular look; hence the low deatiling and four shades of green. The Gameboy was itself an 8-bit system, despite being of the [fourth gaming generation](https://vocadb.net/T/4650/16-bit).
