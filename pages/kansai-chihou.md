>The Kansai region or the Kinki region, lies in the southern-central region of Japan's main island Honshuu.
The region includes the prefectures of Nara, Wakayama, Kyoto, Osaka, Hyougo and Shiga, often also Mie, sometimes Fukui, Tokushima and Tottori.
While the use of the terms "Kansai" and "Kinki" have changed over history, in most modern contexts the use of the two terms is interchangeable.
The metropolitan region of Osaka, Kobe and Kyoto (Keihanshin region) is the second-most populated in Japan after the Greater Tokyo Area.
