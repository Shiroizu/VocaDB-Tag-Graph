#Themes

A monk is a person who practices religious asceticism by monastic living, either alone or with any number of other monks.
A monk may be a person who decides to dedicate his life to serving all other living beings, or to be an ascetic who voluntarily chooses to leave mainstream society and live his or her life in prayer and contemplation.
The concept is ancient and can be seen in many religions and in philosophy.
