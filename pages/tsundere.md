From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundere):
> Tsundere is a Japanese term for a character development process that describes a person who is initially cold (and sometimes even hostile) before gradually showing a warmer, friendlier side over time.

This tag applies to:

* Songs where characters are portrayed as tsundere
* Albums with multiple songs featuring tsundere characters
* Artists that make songs featuring tsundere characters
* Vocalists who canonically have a tsundere personality
