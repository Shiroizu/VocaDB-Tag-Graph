From [Frutiger-Aero.org](https://frutiger-aero.org/frutiger-metro):
>Frutiger Metro, also known as Flat Frutiger Aero, Vector Metro, or Vector Vomit, is an expansive design aesthetic that encapsulates the "Frutiger" vector-based graphic designs of the 2000s. It features glossy textures, abstract flourishes, humanism, nature-inspired elements, gradient blocks, and bloom effects.
