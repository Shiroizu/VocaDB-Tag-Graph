#Genres

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamelan):
>Gamelan is the traditional ensemble music of the Javanese, Sundanese, and Balinese peoples of Indonesia, made up predominantly of percussive instruments. The most common instruments used are metallophones played by mallets and a set of hand-played drums called kendhang/Kendang, which register the beat. The kemanak (a banana-shaped idiophone) and gangsa (another metallophone) are commonly used gamelan instruments in Bali. Other instruments include xylophones, bamboo flutes, a bowed instrument called a rebab, a zither-like instrument siter (in Javanese ensemble) and vocalists named sindhen (Female) or gerong (Male).

Gamelan is a traditional Indonesian musical form, often consisting of a mix of various mallet percussion instruments, flutes, hand drums, and vocals.
