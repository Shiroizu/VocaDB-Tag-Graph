#Instruments

The double bass, also known as contrabass or upright bass, is a large bowed string instrument. It's thought to be a descendant of the [viol family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viol), not the newer violin family like the [violin](https://vocadb.net/T/459), viola, and [cello](https://vocadb.net/T/4815). Despite that, it's commonly used as the lowest voice in the string section doubling the cellos' part, and it's also widely used outside orchestral settings (though mostly played with plucking/pizzicato).

Modern standard double bass has four strings, which tuned in E1,  A1, D2, and G2 like the [bass guitar](https://vocadb.net/T/1656). Its part sounds an octave lower than written.
