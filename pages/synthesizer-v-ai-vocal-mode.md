#Vocalists

A feature added to some SynthV AI voicebanks in Synthesizer V Studio 1.6.0 update:

> Creators can now use the “Vocal Mode” section in the Voice panel to select among or mix a handful of presets such as “chest”, “open”, “soft”, “clear”, thereby customizing out a richer and more versatile sound tailored for their work.
_(from the official website)_

Please note that this tag is not to be used for artists who frequently use the feature
