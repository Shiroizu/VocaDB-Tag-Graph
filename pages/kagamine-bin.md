Kagamine Bottle (Kagamine Rin + Bottle) is an MMD model created by [ポッジーニ(Pogini)](https://vocadb.net/Ar/15891)   and first appeared in the song  [いなにわ](https://vocadb.net/S/247888)

Kagamine Bottle is inspired by the VOCALOID2 character Kagamine Rin, but with the appearance of a milk bottle with arms and legs, a handle simulating Rin's bow, and the "MILK" logo under her face. 

Kagamine Bottle has appeared in some of Pogini's videos and has starred in the song [ふりかけ](https://vocadb.net/S/247890)
