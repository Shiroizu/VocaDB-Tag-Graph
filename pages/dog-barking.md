#Instruments

Dog barks (and other canine vocalizations) are used in songs usually by sampling a real dog, or replicating the sound with a synthesizer.

This tag is for:
- Songs that feature a dog’s bark.
- Vocal synthesizers that are either based on recordings of real dogs, or designed to sound like them.
