>"2channel, also known as 2ch, Channel 2, and sometimes retrospectively as 2ch.net, was an anonymous Japanese textboard founded in 1999 by Hiroyuki Nishimura.
Described in 2007 as "Japan's most popular online community", the site had a level of influence comparable to that of traditional mass media such as television, radio, and magazines.
At the time, the site drew an annual revenue of around ¥100 million, and was the largest of its kind in the world, with around ten million visitors and 2.5 million posts made per day."
