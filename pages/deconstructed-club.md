#Genres

Deconstructed club,also known as post-club or deconstructed music is an experimental electronic dance music genre, called to be a post-modernism equivalent to house and techno.
The style was born in New York dance parties named GHE20G0TH1K, which started in 2009. These parties featured voguers, punks, and fashionista, took place in warehouses across Brooklyn and Manhattan and started to radicalize the city's nightclub scene within a year. The style that defined the deconstructed club movement was directly shaped by the possibilities of CDJs, and DJ sets, in turn, have inspired producers to imitate this chaotic experimentation in their own music, creating feedback that continued to re-imagine the expectations of the dance-floor music. The MP3s used by DJs on GHE20G0TH1K had a crunchy, cruddy texture while being played on a big sound system, which came to define their aesthetic. Each member of the collective came from a different background, but they incorporated those differences into the mix, hybridizing a melange of Jersey club, Baltimore, footwork, and punk music, as well as elements of house and techno.
Artists from the labels Night Slugs, Fade to Mind, and Keysound, that mixed together rebooted ballroom/vogue house and the new wave of instrumental grime, all with a stark, hi-tech machine sheen are also called among the pioneers of the genre.

The term itself started circulating in the mid-2010s and was used as a sort of lasso term to describe a disparate, international genus of producers taking club music and turning it avant-garde.
