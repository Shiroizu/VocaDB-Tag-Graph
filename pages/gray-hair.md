#Vocalists

An intermediate color between [black](https://vocadb.net/T/8914/black) and [white](https://vocadb.net/T/8913/white).
It is a neutral or achromatic color, meaning literally that it is "without color", because it can be composed of [black](https://vocadb.net/T/8914/black) and [white](https://vocadb.net/T/8913/white).

- This tag is for characters with grey hair.
-> It may overlap with white for very pale silver, or black for a very dark charcoal.
