#Derivative

A genderbend of [Masami Honoka](https://vocadb.net/Ar/101810).

Height: 5'6ft (167.5cm)
Weight: 112 lbs (50.8 kg)

Hono is LAZY. Yes, this kid can’t do anything without one complaint about him being tired. He is the older fraternal twin. He likes the morning, often waking up early to watch the sun rise and have a cup of coffee (his favourite). He is a kuudere. He likes to play the keytar alone in his room. He games ALL the time and is a computer wiz. He doesn’t really like nature and is better off in the city. He is protective of the girls in the house (Honoka, Kazue, and Takara, but not so much Gizmo since she's a war-bot). He likes dogs better than cats. He keeps his sun pillow in his room, but hides it in the closet because he feels that that's shotaish and only brings it out at night. Honoka and Hono are very alike sometimes. He is more clever than Honoka.

Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
