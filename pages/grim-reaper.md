#Themes

>Death is frequently imagined as a personified force.
In some mythologies, a character known as the Grim Reaper (usually depicted as a berobed skeleton wielding a scythe) causes the victim's death by coming to collect that person's soul.
Other beliefs hold that the Spectre of Death is only a psychopomp, a benevolent figure who serves to gently sever the last ties between the soul and the body, and to guide the deceased to the afterlife, without having any control over when or how the victim dies.
Death is most often personified in male form, although in certain cultures Death is perceived as female (for instance, Marzanna in Slavic mythology, or Santa Muerte in Mexico).
Death is also portrayed as one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

>Shinigami are kami that invite humans toward death in certain aspects of Japanese religion and culture.
Shinigami have been described as monsters, helpers, and creatures of darkness.
Shinigami are used for tales and religions in Japanese culture.
