#Genres

>Drill 'n' bass is a style of electronic music which developed in the mid-1990s as IDM artists began experimenting with elements of drum and bass, breakbeat, and jungle music. Artists utilized powerful audio software programs and deployed frenzied, irregular tempos that often discouraged dancing. (from Wikipedia)
