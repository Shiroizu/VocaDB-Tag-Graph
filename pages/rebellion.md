#Themes

Songs in which someone, typically a child (or children), rebel against an ideal or society, commonly that of adults or schools. Can apply to songs or albums based upon this plot. Can also apply to when a character isn't directly rebelling, but resents society, &/or wants or attempts to rebel.
