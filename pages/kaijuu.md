From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiju):
>Kaijū is a Japanese film genre that features giant monsters, usually attacking major cities and engaging the military and other monsters in battle. [...] The term kaiju translates to "strange beast". It is a science fiction and fantasy giant creature that often takes the role of either antagonist, protagonist, or force of nature. Godzilla is an example of a kaiju; others include Rodan, Mothra, King Ghidorah, Mechagodzilla, King Kong, Gamera, Gyaos, Daimajin, Gappa, Guilala and Yonggary.
