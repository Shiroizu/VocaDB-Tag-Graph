#Composition

"Dissonance" is a musical term for notes that sound harsh or 'wrong' when paired together. While it can be a sign of a poor composition, dissonance is often purposefully used to create a dark, unsettling atmosphere.

Do not confuse this with ["lyrical dissonance"](https://vocadb.net/T/9789/lyrical-dissonance), a term documenting songs with an atmospheric mismatch instead.
