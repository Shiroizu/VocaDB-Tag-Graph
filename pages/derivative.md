#Derivative

Mostly for fanmade (unofficial) voice synth voice configurations. 

By default, derivative characters (fanmade or official) without their own voicebank should be indicated with tags **instead of artist entries**.

For characters that are only alternative designs/outfits of existing characters and are not used with voice configurations, use the [alternative-design](https://vocadb.net/T/9075/alternative-design) tags instead.

**Parent tag hierarchy:**
[subderivative](https://vocadb.net/T/6989/subderivative) > [voice synth genderswap](https://vocadb.net/T/1718/voice-synth-genderswap) > [other derived voicebank](https://vocadb.net/T/10865/other-derived-voicebank) > derived UTAU, derived Vocaloid, etc.

(for example, if derived voicebank is both a subderivative and a derived UTAU, prioritize setting subderivative as the parent tag)
