#Derivative

For songs or albums that explicitly define the use of the derivative, **Kagene Rui**.

**Rui** is a derived voice configuration for the VOCALOID [Kagamine Rin](http://vocadb.net/Ar/48800) in which the original voicebank is adjusted to a *higher* pitch. She is intended to be the mirror image of Rin. She is the sister of [Kagene Rei](http://vocadb.net/T/6418/kagene-rei).

**Rui** was illustrated by [はねぽち](http://vocadb.net/Ar/34003) (Hanepochi).

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
