#Sources

This tag indicates that a cover uses an out-of-scope arrangement. In other words, this cover does not use the original instrumental, nor is it a cover of an in-scope remix; instead, it uses an instrumental not found in the database.
This can apply to both covers of in-scope works and covers of out-of-scope works. If this tag is applicable, then please list the arrangement used and arranger of it in the description.

For instance, music producer [tatsuikami](https://vocadb.net/Ar/83706) has multiple covers that fall under this tag. 
- Their [cover](https://vocadb.net/S/500057) of 40mP's in-scope song ["Summer Love Fireworks"](https://vocadb.net/S/1376) utilizes 花歩's [arrangement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZMXYlQ_D04); the arrangement has no vocal synths, thus making it out-of-scope.
- Similarly, their [cover](https://vocadb.net/S/482152) of Mr.Child's out-of-scope "innocent world" makes use of Hachi Nori's [arrangement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LED4swKF3MI); since this arrangement also uses no vocal synths, it thus falls out-of-scope as well. 

Since neither of the arrangements used were in-scope, tatsuikami's covers thus recieved this tag.
