#Languages

> _Southern Min_, or _Min Nan_, is a branch of _Min_ Chinese spoken in certain parts of China including southern Fujian, eastern Guangdong, Hainan, and southern Zhejiang, and in Taiwan.
> _Hokkien_ is the mainstream form of _Southern Min_, and is the variety spoken widely in the south-eastern part of Fujian and in Taiwan, and by the Chinese diaspora in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and other parts of Southeast Asia, and by other overseas Chinese all over the world.
>*-- From Wikipedia*

_Southern Min_, or more specifically, _Hokkien_, as the major native Taiwanese language, is often referred to as simply "Taiwanese", but it is **NOT to be confused with [_Taiwanese Mandarin_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwanese_Mandarin)**, another national [language of Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Taiwan), where [the tag for Mandarin](https://vocadb.net/T/58) should apply. 

**To be used for**

- Artists who mainly produce in Hokkien or the _Min Nan_ language. 
- Albums with mainly Min Nan songs. 
- Songs with majority of the vocals in Min Nan.
