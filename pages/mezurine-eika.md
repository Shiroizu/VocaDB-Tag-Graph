The personality of Mezurine Eika is mainly depicted as sinister and a bit ominous. She could be considered evil at times but is mostly neutral. She mainly represents a darker side of Megurine Luka but more in the sense of being the Yin of Luka's Yin Yang. She is mainly found to be writing in her poem notebook when alone however she is very open to others socially. Her love life however is something very touchy and mainly you do not want to talk with about her. She has never had a single relationship in her life that may be due to her specific tastes in men.

She is also known to be very manipulative even when others are unconciously being manipulated by her. Most of the time it is to get a particular thing she wants which isn't many things nor very important things either. The only thing she doesn't want to manipulate that she wants is a passionate love. Eika also manipulates just for the sake of figuring out what kind of person you are and what your darkest secrets are however her dark secrets are almost completely unreachable even from her closest friends and loved ones.

Also like Luka in some senses she is sometimes a Tsundere as well at times being somewhat cold even though she will respond to anyone who talks to her. This is where the ominous aspects of her come in where she is perfectly social yet she seems even more distant from others that way being more analytic than relatable. She is not afraid to state her point and often has almost all the information on her interests down to the roots of where they originated from.
