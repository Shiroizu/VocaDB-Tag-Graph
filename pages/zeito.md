#Derivative

Zeito is a black and red themed derivative of the official Vocaloid Kaito and is created by BloodyVocaloid. His name is a combination of "Kaito" and "Ze". His name is a pun on the word "zetto", which is the Japanese word for the letter "Z". Due to his black and red color scheme, it is often said he is the Kaito equivalent of what Zatsune Miku is to Hatsune Miku.

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
