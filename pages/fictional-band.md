#Themes

For songs where the author either:

1. Writes a story (usually in a sort of documentary style) in a song's description about how a work was published by a (non-existent) band. 
Example: 
> [「有名バンドが好きだったゆえに解散後に人気になった系バンドのベスト盤」](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm40893460)
2. Where a fictional band is formed within the context of the song itself
