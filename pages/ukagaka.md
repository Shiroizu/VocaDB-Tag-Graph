Ukagaka is a (type of) desktop mascot application that serves as a platform for interactive user-created characters/character pairs named *ghosts*.

MATERIA is the original platform; it is long discontinued.

SSP for Windows is currently the most common platform.

FLELE is a music player ghost, for which various *shells* (skins) have been made.
