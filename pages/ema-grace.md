#Derivative

**Ema Grace** is a fictional virtual singer created by [Ryoma Maeda](https://vocadb.net/Ar/96303). She was first introduced in the EP [*FAKE*](https://vocadb.net/Al/30111), released in February 1st 2019, as a "fake idol".
Her voice was created using an unknown feminine VOCALOID voicebank capable to sing in English as a base, and a random copyright free stock photo was chosen to represent her. Initially, Ryoma used to describe her as an "AI Singer&Idol", but as no AI technology is used to make Ema's voice, he stopped to call her like that (despite this description is still present in her official social medias).

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
