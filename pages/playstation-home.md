#Copyrights

> PlayStation Home was a virtual 3D social gaming platform developed by Sony Computer Entertainment's London Studio for the PlayStation 3 (PS3) on the PlayStation Network (PSN). 
It was accessible from the PS3's XrossMediaBar (XMB). 
Membership was free but required a PSN account. 
Upon installation, users could choose how much hard disk space they wished to reserve for Home. 
Development of the service began in early 2005 and it launched as an open beta on 11 December 2008. 
Home remained as a perpetual beta until its closure on 31 March 2015.
