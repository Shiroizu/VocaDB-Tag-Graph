#Derivative

Nene Sotone is a fanmade jointly created by Rena-tan (aka. Hankyou), and later by Orochi Herman. Nene has since been accepted into the Polygloid roster by Orochi Herman, and has appeared at least once in his videos.

"Nene" (ネネ) is her pet name taken from the first two letters of her real name, Nenita (ネニーた), and Netsuko. Nene is also a typical nickname for girls in the Philippines. "Sotone" (外音) means Outside sound, just like with her elder siblings like Riza.
