From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword):
>A sword is a bladed melee weapon intended for cutting or thrusting that is longer than a knife or dagger, consisting of a long blade attached to a hilt. The precise definition of the term varies with the historical epoch or the geographic region under consideration. The blade can be straight or curved. Thrusting swords have a pointed tip on the blade, and tend to be straighter; slashing swords have a sharpened cutting edge on one or both sides of the blade, and are more likely to be curved. Many swords are designed for both thrusting and slashing.

This tag applies to:

* Songs/albums/PVs where swords appear in the video or illustration
* Songs/albums related to swords, or the usage of swords
* Vocalists depicted using/holding swords in their official illustration
