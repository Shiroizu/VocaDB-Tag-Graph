#Instruments

The clarinet is a single-reed woodwind instrument. It is the largest woodwind family with various sizes and keys. It's a common member of orchestras and music bands.

The art is by [coba](https://vocadb.net/Ar/78871). It depicts Kagamine Rin playing the B♭ soprano clarinet (the most common type) and Kagamine Len playing the B♭ bass clarinet.
