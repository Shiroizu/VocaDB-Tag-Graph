#Instruments

An electronic musical instrument that generates audio signals. 
Synthesizers generate audio through methods including subtractive synthesis, additive synthesis, and frequency modulation synthesis. 
These sounds may be shaped and modulated by components such as filters, envelopes, and low-frequency oscillators. 
Synthesizers are typically played with keyboards or controlled by sequencers, software, or other instruments, often via MIDI. [Sumida's](https://vocadb.net/Ar/16724) illustration depicts a physical keyboard synthesizer.
