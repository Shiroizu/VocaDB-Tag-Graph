#Animation

A super-deformed version of Hatsune Miku created by [Yukino Tamago](https://vocadb.net/Ar/16842) for the famous [Ievan Polkka PV](https://vocadb.net/S/638). Her name was decided by [Otomania](https://vocadb.net/Ar/57), the remix creator. She became highly popular upon her debut and remained a commonly used character for several years afterward.

Hachune Miku is commonly characterized as a silly, dim-witted, childish girl who loves to eat. Depending on the setting, she is either a direct persona of Hatsune Miku, or a separate character who is typically much smaller.

She became officially recognized by Crypton Future Media in November 2007 and has appeared in official material since 2008.
