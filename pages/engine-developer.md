#Jobs

Similar to [voicebank developer](https://vocadb.net/T/6213/voicebank-developer), the "engine developer" tag is for people or groups who have created [vocal synthesizer engines](https://vocadb.net/T/7373/vocal-synthesizer) [or programs](https://vocadb.net/T/6109/other-vocal-synthesis-engine). Unlike the former, however, this tag may be applied to individuals.
