>Ultraman, also known as the Ultra Series, is the collective name for all media produced by Tsuburaya Productions featuring Ultraman, his many brethren, and the myriad monsters.
Debuting with Ultra Q and then Ultraman in 1966, the series is one of the most prominent tokusatsu superhero genre productions from Japan, along with the Toei-produced series Kamen Rider, Super Sentai and the Metal Heroes.
The series is also one of the most well-known examples of the kaiju genre, along with Toho's Godzilla series and Daiei Film's Gamera series. However, the series also falls into the Kyodai Hero subgenre of tokusatsu, a subgenre it also helped popularise.
