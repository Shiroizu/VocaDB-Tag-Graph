#Editor_notes

#### This tag is now deprecated. Entries tagged with this tag will eventually have the original artist set as the vocal data provider on said entries and have this tag removed.
#### **After this tag is empty, the tag can be deleted.**


If the cover/remix artist has used vocal data (UST, VSQx, CCS, etc.) from the original creator in their cover, then mark it with this tag.
