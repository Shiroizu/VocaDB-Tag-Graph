#Instruments

>An eight-string bass guitar is a type of bass guitar with double course strings normally tuned in octaves, with both strings in a course usually played simultaneously. (From Wikipedia)

The 8-string bass can be divided into three common styles: coursed strings, which consist of four courses of two strings typically tuned EADG, doubling at the octave (resulting in high E, low E, high A, low A, high D, low D, high G, and low G); and two lower double strings tuned in unison to produce a natural chorus effect, similar to that of a 12-string guitar. The extended-range bass features eight single strings.
