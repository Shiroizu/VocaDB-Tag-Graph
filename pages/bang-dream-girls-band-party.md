#Games

Rhythm music game with gacha mechanics that was developed by Craft Egg, Inc. (until Jan. 4, 2024) and published by Bushiroad Games. It was first released on March 16, 2017 for both iOS and Android devices in Japan, with it later gaining a Traditional Chinese, Korean, English and Simplified Chinese release.  It's based off of Bushiroad's multimedia project [BanG Dream!](https://vocadb.net/T/7495/bang-dream).

This tag should be only added to songs that use their original vocal synth version in the game.
