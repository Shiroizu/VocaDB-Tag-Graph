#Genres

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo_soul):
>Neo soul is a genre of popular music. [...] Heavily based in soul music, neo soul is distinguished by a less conventional sound than its contemporary R&B counterpart, with incorporated elements ranging from jazz, funk, hip hop and electronic to pop, fusion, and African music. It has been noted by music writers for its traditional R&B influences, conscious-driven lyrics, and strong female presence.
