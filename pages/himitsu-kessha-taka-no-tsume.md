*Eagle Talon* was a Flash anime series created by [FROGMAN](https://vocadb.net/Ar/113255) and animated in [Adobe Flash](https://vocadb.net/T/7917/flash). The show followed a group of supervillains as they plotted to defeat a specific superhero. Notably, one of the supervillains is a child-like man named [Yoshida-kun](https://vocadb.net/Ar/2054), who actually has a speech bank within the program, [VOICEROID](https://vocadb.net/T/486/voiceroid).
