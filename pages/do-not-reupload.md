#Editor_notes

Artists who have requested disabling **reprints** on their VocaDB entries.

If you are [a verified artist](https://wiki.vocadb.net/docs/artists/artist-verification), please message a moderator if you want this tag to be added to **your entry**.

The tag can also be added to individual album and song entries. This is allowed but **redundant in most cases**, if the artist entry is already tagged.

The tag effect will be **automatically enforced** in the future (= reprints disabled)
