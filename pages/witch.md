>Witchcraft (also called witchery or spellcraft) broadly means the practice of, and belief in, magical skills and abilities that are able to be exercised by individuals and certain social groups. It often occupies a religious, divinatory or medicinal role, and is often present within societies and groups whose cultural framework includes a magical world view.
>Witchcraft traditionally means the use of magic or supernatural powers to harm others. A practitioner is a witch. In medieval and early modern Europe, where the term originated, accused witches were usually women who were believed to have attacked their own community, and often to have communed with evil beings. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchcraft))

Witches in fictional worlds are often depicted (varies) as either old, with unrealistic skin color (green/blue) and many skin blemishes as well as unruly, grey hair **or** young with a stereotypical attractive body and face with long dark hair.
They usually appear wearing dark robes and long, pointy hats and using brooms to fly.
