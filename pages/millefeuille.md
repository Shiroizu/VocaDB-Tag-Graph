#Vocalists

**Millefeuille** is the name of [Utau French Resources](https://vocadb.net/Ar/132098) and [imsupposedto](https://vocadb.net/Ar/101060)'s French [DiffSinger](https://vocadb.net/T/9389/diffsinger) language support and training kit.

It contains several voices with a wide training corpus as well as language extensions that can fully or partially support at least 3 non-target languages (Japanese, English, Spanish...).

While Millefeuille's corpus contains data for multiple languages (French, English, Japanese and German in-house, as well as additional community-provided data for more languages), Utau French Resources also provides *a public corpus* named "**Petit Millefeuille**", allowing anyone to train their DiffSinger voicebank with French data.

#### This tag may be used for:
- Voicebanks developed by or alongside Utau French Resources with Millefeuille's full corpus
- Voicebanks developed by other individuals using Petit Millefeuille
