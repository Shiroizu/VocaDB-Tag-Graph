#Copyrights

A music creation program for the Nintendo DS that emulates the Korg MS range of synthesizers.
The DS-10 adds sync which the Korg MS-20 is lacking. It was released on July 24, 2008 in Japan, October 10, 2008 in Europe, and November 4, 2008 in the United States.

A newer, DSi compatible version, entitled KORG DS-10 Plus, was released in Japan on September 17, 2009 and in the United States on February 16, 2010. It doubles the number of synth and drum machines when played on DSi/3DS system. It also adds some minor new features for the standard DS.

KORG iDS-10 for iPhone combines a virtual analog synthesizer, voice synthesizer, and drum machine, inspired by the design of the Nintendo DS-10.
