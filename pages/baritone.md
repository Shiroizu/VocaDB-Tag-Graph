#Vocalists

The middle **male** voice typically between A2 and A4.

___

>A **baritone** is a type of classical **male** singing voice whose vocal range lies between the **bass** and the **tenor** voice-types.
The term originates from the Greek βαρύτονος (barýtonos), meaning "heavy sounding".
Composers typically write music for this voice in the range from the second F below middle C to the F above middle C (i.e. F2–F4) in choral music, and from the second G below middle C to the G above middle C (G2 to G4) in operatic music, but the range can extend at either end.
Subtypes of **baritone** include the baryton-Martin baritone (light baritone), lyric baritone, Kavalierbariton, Verdi baritone, dramatic baritone, baryton-noble baritone, and the bass-baritone.
