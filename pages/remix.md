#Sources

Remix is an edited version of the song, usually made to sound quite different. The remix is often different musical genre from the original. This song type should also be used even when the remix was made by the original artist. In this case you should add the self-remix tag.

#### Tag usage instructions

* Albums - Most of the tracks are remixes.
* Artist - Produces mainly remixes.
* As a secondary type for remix songs. Note that this tag is redundant if the song type is already "remix".
