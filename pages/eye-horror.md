#Themes

A variant of body horror where the eyes specifically, instead of the body in general, are shown being violated. It can also refer to eyes being in 'unusual places', like a person's hands or the wall of the room, especially if the eyes are shown being *everywhere*.

The art is by [さほ](https://vocadb.net/Ar/35945).
