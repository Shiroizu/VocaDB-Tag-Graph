#Derivative

Yamine Aku is a derivative character that is typically presented using Hatsune Miku's voice. She is referenced as a Hocaloid (放火ロイド), which translates to Arsonloid or Fireloid (a reference to flame wars). She has both a teen and adult form, with her later teen design being more widely recognized.

She was created and illustrated by Xai. Originally, she was intended as a personification of 2ch users speculated to be undercover corporate agents in the legal battle between Crypton and Dwango, but she has since become a more general character. She is said to be a former singing robot who is now a domineering combat android with control over fire.
