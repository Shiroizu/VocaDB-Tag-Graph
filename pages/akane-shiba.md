#Derivative

**Akane Shiba** is the unofficial BOUKALOID derivative of Crypton Future Media's [Megurine Luka](https://vocadb.net/Ar/2). She was created by Benzarro85 in 2023.

TW:// Mentioning a criminal/tragic event.

Akane Shiba is one of the workers of the "Anti Miku campaign" that sparked the hatred of Hatsune Miku by Japanese media outlets in 2007. She is a massive workaholic and tsundere. She runs bulletin boards, news outlets and forums in order to tarnish Miku's image.

Because she works with Neru and the Japanese news media, she looks like Neru, with the exception of having her strand of hair on the right side, and her ponytail being at the top, rather than the left side. She also has only one arm warmer (whatever it's called). Her tattoo is DEN3.

She is a massive internet troll, and is a nasty person. She is one of the many trolls who led to Tomohiro Kato's breaking point, and she was unintentionally the cause for the Akihabara Massacre that occurred in June 8th, 2008.
