#Themes

"Disability" is a wide-reaching term referring to a large variety of health conditions. This tag can be used for songs and albums about disabilities as a whole, specific disabilities, or even the societal prejudice against them (ableism). This may also be applied to voicebanks and characters who are canonically disabled.
