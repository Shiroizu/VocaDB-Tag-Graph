> _Pien (ぴえん)_ represents the sound of crying to express mild sadness or disappointment. In online usage, it is frequently paired with the puppy eyes of the “pleading face” emoji (🥺). _(Nippon.com)_

> _Pien-kei_ is a category of women's fashion trends, characteristics and attributes, generally used in the sense of "girls with _pien_-like behavior and mentality". It is commonly used with nuances such as "people who often use sad expressions, such as _"pien"_, when they are having a hard time or when they want someone to take care of them", "people who wear make-up or dress in a way that makes them look sad". _(Weblio.jp)_
