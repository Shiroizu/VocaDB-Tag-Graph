#Copyrights

A theatrical anime film released on Janurary 17th, 2025. It's based off of the mobile gacha rhythm game "[Project SEKAI COLORFUL STAGE! feat. Hatsune Miku](https://vocadb.net/T/7323/proseka)"

Plot synopsis ([Project Sekai Wikia](https://projectsekai.fandom.com/wiki/Project_SEKAI_the_Movie:_Kowareta_SEKAI_to_Utaenai_MIKU#Plot))
>[Hoshino Ichika](https://vocadb.net/Ar/83062) hears a song by Miku that she has never heard before at a music store. She finds a "[Hatsune Miku](https://vocadb.net/Ar/1)," who she has never seen before in the TV screen, and says aloud "Miku!?". Although their eyes meet, Miku is startled by Ichika's voice and disappears.

>Later, after Ichika finishes her street performance, Miku appears again in Ichika's smartphone. Ichika asks the sad-looking Miku what is troubling her and finds out that there are people who Miku wants to deliver her song to, but no matter how much she sings, her voice won't reach them.

>After seeing Ichika reach people's hearts with her song, Miku thinks that she can do the same by learning more about Ichika. Ichika smiles and agrees to help. Join Miku and her friends as a new story begins!
