#Themes

>Jirai Kei (地雷系/じらいけい) translates to "landmine-type" and is derived from "jirai onna" (地雷女) which is a derogatory term that refers to a type of a woman that has a high tendency to have violent emotional breakdowns.
(...)
Jirai Kei, similar to Yami Kawaii, has associations with some darker or disturbing themes.
In this case, Jirai Kei may be associated with binge drinking, heavy partying, self-harm, suicide, prostitution, and other rebellious and shocking behaviors.
*-Wiki*

It is also a fashion style (in Japan) consisting of dark but cute elements. Main color-themes are usually pink, violet and black.
