> _Shinto_ is a religion which originated in Japan. Classified as an East Asian religion by scholars of religion, its practitioners often regard it as Japan's indigenous religion and as a nature religion. There is no central authority in control of Shinto and much diversity exists among practitioners. (Wikipedia)
