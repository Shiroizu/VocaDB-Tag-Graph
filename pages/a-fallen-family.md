#Series

"  Things don't look any better. It reeks of resentment in my cabin and I can't even get out. We've lost everything and it's all my fault. I am hoping that I could get some help before things are worse but my luck is running low. Therefore, I'll stay here and hope for the best. This is Crysta1 K. Charlotte, logging off until I figure things out." - Zyla Zo.
