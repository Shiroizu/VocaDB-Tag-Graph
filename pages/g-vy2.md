#Derivative

For songs or albums that explicitly define the use of the derivative, G-VY2. She is the female version of VOCALOID [VY2](https://vocadb.net/Ar/118).

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku
