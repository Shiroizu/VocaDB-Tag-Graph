From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secrecy):
> Secrecy is the practice of hiding information from certain individuals or groups who do not have the "need to know", perhaps while sharing it with other individuals.

This tag should be used in songs or albums where the main focus is on secrets or the act of keeping or hiding information from a certain individual or group.
