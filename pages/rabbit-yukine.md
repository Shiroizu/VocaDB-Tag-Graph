Yukine (ユキネ) is Snow Miku's pet rabbit. It appeared first in a 2014 design contest consisting of a Magical Girl theme.

Illustrator: [KEI](https://vocadb.net/Ar/9213)

From [SnowMiku.com](https://snowmiku.com/2022/info_snowmiku_en.html):
>"Rabbit Yukine" is a character as a pet of "SNOW MIKU" and was designed using lepus timidus ainu (a kind of mountain hare) as a motif.
>In 2014, it was born by being chosen as "SNOW MIKU"'s pet, the character based on animals in winter of Hokkaido, from among the public. From 2015, the costume design for "Rabbit Yukine" is also selected in an online competition along with "SNOW MIKU".
>Nowadays, Yukine alone has participated in various initiatives to enliven Hokkaido and has been serving as an ambassador..
