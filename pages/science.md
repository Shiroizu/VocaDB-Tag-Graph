#Themes

A systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.
Modern science is typically divided into three major branches:

- the natural sciences, which study nature in the broadest sense (biology, chemistry, physics)
- the social sciences, which study individuals and societies (economics, psychology, sociology)
- the formal sciences, which study abstract concepts (logic, mathematics, theoretical computer science)
