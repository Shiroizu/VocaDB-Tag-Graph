#Vocalists

An "innate voicebank" is one that comes installed within a program no matter what, requiring no extra purchases or downloads.
Perhaps the most famous example lies within Vocaloid5, with which every version of the program comes with 4 voicebanks attached ([Amy](https://vocadb.net/Ar/67101), [Chris](https://vocadb.net/Ar/67102), [Kaori](https://vocadb.net/Ar/67103), and [Ken](https://vocadb.net/Ar/67104).)

Note that some programs have a "default voicebank". This is a bank that not only comes with the program, but also acts as the program's backup plan if no other banks are selected. For those voicebanks, please use the [associated child tag](https://vocadb.net/T/9358).
