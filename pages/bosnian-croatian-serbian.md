#Languages

Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian are a set of [mutually intelligible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_intelligibility) languages. Montengrin is another member of this family, albeit one less commonly brought up. This tag can be used for:

- Artists who mainly produce in this language set (location is irrelevant).
- Voicebanks who are designed to be able to sing in it
- Albums with mainly BCS songs.
- Songs with majority of the vocals in BCS.
