#Instruments

The 12-string bass is a bass guitar with four sets of triple-coursed octave strings, where each of the four main strings has two additional smaller strings, and each higher string is tuned in unison but slightly out of tune, reminiscent of a 12-string guitar. Best known for songs using the 12-string bass is "Jeremy" by Pearl Jam, where the intro can clearly be heard.

Note that this tag is also for songs featuring bass that emulates the sound of a 12-string bass, with pitch-shift effects applied an octave up and a slight chorus effect.
