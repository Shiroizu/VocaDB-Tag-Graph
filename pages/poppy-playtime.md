#Copyrights

> Poppy Playtime is a survival horror video game developed and published by American indie developer MOB Games.
The player takes the role of a former employee of toy-making company Playtime Co., who revisits its abandoned toy factory 10 years after its staff's disappearance.
The player navigates through a first-person perspective and must solve puzzles, some requiring a gadget named the GrabPack, to progress while avoiding various enemies.
