#Derivative

For songs or albums that explicitly define the use of the derivative, **Akita Neruto**.

Akita Neruto, sometimes referred to as Neruo or Neruma, is the genderswapped derivative of [Akita Neru](https://vocadb.net/T/7204). He has a fixed set of voice configurations.

The main creator, Yulian The Teen, created Neruo Akita as Akita Neru's gender swap, the design is based on an image of Akita Neru so that Akita Neruto's Tsundere personality can be seen a bit. The second creator didn't put an image or personality.
