From Wikipedia:
>In Japan, a salaryman is a salaried worker.
In Japanese popular culture, this is embodied by a white-collar worker who shows overriding loyalty and commitment to the corporation where he works.

>Salarypeople are expected to work long hours, to put in additional overtime, to participate in after-work leisure activities such as drinking, singing karaoke and visiting hostess bars with colleagues, and to value work over all else.
The salaryman typically enters a company after graduating from college and stays with that corporation for the duration of his career.
