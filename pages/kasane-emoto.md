#Derivative

Kasane Emoto is based off of the UTAU, [Kasane Teto](https://vocadb.net/Ar/116). Emoto was created when Hito-P was bored and decided to recolor Teto's boxart in paint. His voice changed from just being pitched down Teto, to pitched down Teto with a g-flag.
She is an Annoyloid, like [Kagami Kawaiine](https://vocadb.net/T/8945).
