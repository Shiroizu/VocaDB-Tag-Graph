#Vocalists

Vocoflex is a two-part program: one, it allows for hex-based generation of brand new vocals; two, it allows for people to modify and adjust pre-existing vocals (including those made in the hex generation).

This tag is for songs where Vocoflex was used entirely as an audio effects plugin. As these have originating voicebanks, the original voicebank used should be set as the song's artist.
