#Themes

A composite color.
In terms of the visible spectrum, "brown" refers to long wavelength hues, [yellow](https://vocadb.net/T/8915/yellow), [orange](https://vocadb.net/T/8911/orange-color), or [red](https://vocadb.net/T/8912/red), in combination with low luminance or saturation.

Brown is a strange colour, as it mostly acts as a background neutral for others.
However, brown may be used as a focal point to indicate rusticness or a closeness to nature.

The page image is by [Hasewo](https://vocadb.net/Ar/69328); it depicts [Urone If](https://vocadb.net/Ar/56771), a steampunk plague doctor UTAU, sitting against a brown backhround. The background has light vine motifs, playing into brown's association with nature.

**This is a theme color tag! These tags are meant to denote videos or characters with a distinctive focal color, or songs *about* said color. Not everything needs to be tagged with these.**
