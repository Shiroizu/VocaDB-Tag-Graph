#Themes

While Vocaloids are famous for their distinctive characters, there *are* some voicebanks that come without a clear character design, instead featuring relevant [letters](https://vocadb.net/T/14) or vague imagery on their box. This tag is designed for these very voicebanks, the ones that, for whatever reason, deign not to have a mascot. Note that many of these voicebanks receive fan designs, with a few (VY1 and VY2 in particular) having official humanoid designs; however, their base, canonical design features no real identifiable mascot, thus making them applicable for this tag.

If the character has a set design that is meant to represent the voicebank, then no matter how weird it is, it does *not* count for this tag. This tag is for voicebanks that are meant to act as disembodied sounds represented only through fan depictions or even nothing at all.

Art by [tundras](https://piapro.jp/coladary). It depicts the full, canonical design of the Vocaloid [LEON](https://vocadb.net/Ar/386): blue lips, a bit of a nose, and nothing much else.
