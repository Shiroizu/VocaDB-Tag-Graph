> The _tarot_ is a pack of playing cards, used from at least the mid-15th century in various parts of Europe to play card games. (...) In the late 18th century, French occultists began to make elaborate, but unsubstantiated, claims about their history and meaning, leading to the emergence of custom decks for use in divination via tarot card reading and cartomancy. Thus there are two distinct types of tarot pack: those used for playing games and those used for divination. _(Wikipedia)_
