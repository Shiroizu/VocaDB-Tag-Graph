#Themes

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost):
>In folklore, a ghost (sometimes known as an apparition, haunt, phantom, poltergeist, shade, specter or spectre, spirit, spook, and wraith) is the soul or spirit of a dead person or animal that can appear to the living. In ghostlore, descriptions of ghosts vary widely from an invisible presence to translucent or barely visible wispy shapes, to realistic, lifelike visions. 

Applies to:

* Songs themed around, or featuring, ghosts
* Albums with multiple songs about ghosts
* Artists who make songs/PVs about ghosts
* Vocalists canonically portrayed as a ghost
