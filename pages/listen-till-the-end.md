#Subjective

Tag for songs and videos that:
* have bonus sequence after the main part;
* are long and have interesting developments;
* unexpectedly change their overall tone and/or meaning towards the end.

Main goal of this tag is to indicate that by not watching or listening till the end you might miss something interesting.
