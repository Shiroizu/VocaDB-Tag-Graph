#Copyrights

Project Moon is a Korean game development studio. Currently, three games - all within the same universe - have been released: *Lobotomy Corporation*, a monster management sim; *Library of Ruina*, a turn-based deckbuilding RPG; and *Limbus Company*, a gacha RPG. This tag covers anything that references either one of those games or the series as a whole.

The [tag art](https://twitter.com/I_missed_window/status/1731857026790064547) is an illustration of the *Limbus Company's* protagonist, Dante, dressed as Hatsune Miku. It was drawn by [Patchfire on Twitter](https://twitter.com/I_missed_window/status/1731857026790064547).
