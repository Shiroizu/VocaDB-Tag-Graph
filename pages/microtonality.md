#Composition

Microtonal music or microtonality is the use in music of microtones—intervals smaller than a semitone, also called "microintervals". 
It may also be extended to include any music using intervals not found in the customary Western tuning of twelve equal intervals per octave. 
In other words, a microtone may be thought of as a note that falls between the keys of a piano tuned in equal temperament.
