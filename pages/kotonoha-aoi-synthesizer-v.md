#Vocalists

**This entry should be used when Kotonoha Aoi (Synthesizer V or Seiren Voice) is specified in the title, description, or video of the media (song and/or album) as a vocalist.**

- This tag should **not** be used if [Kotonoha Akane](https://vocadb.net/T/7758/kotonoha-akane-synthesizer-v) is also mentioned (using both tags is redudant)
- This tag should **not** be used for any of Aoi's split banks (such as her Voiceroid banks)

>The Synthesizer V version and the Seiren Voice version both contains only one voice for both character, meaning that the sisters use the exact bank.
Different parameters in the program can be used to produce two different sounding voices.
