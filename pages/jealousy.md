#Themes

> **Jealousy** generally refers to the thoughts or feelings of insecurity, fear, and concern over a relative lack of possessions or safety.
**Jealousy** can consist of one or more emotions such as anger, resentment, inadequacy, helplessness or disgust.
In its original meaning, **jealousy** is distinct from **envy**, though the two terms have popularly become synonymous in the English language, with **jealousy** now also taking on the definition originally used for **envy** alone.
These two emotions are often confused with each other, since they tend to appear in the same situation.
