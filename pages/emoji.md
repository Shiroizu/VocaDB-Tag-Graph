#Themes

>An **emoji** is a **pictogram, logogram, ideogram or smiley embedded in text** and used in **electronic messages** and **web pages**.
The primary function of emoji is to fill in emotional cues otherwise missing from typed conversation.
Some examples of emoji are 😂, 😃, 🧘🏻‍♂️, 🌍, 🌦️, 🍞, 🚗, 📞, 🎉, ❤️, 🍆, 🏁, among many others.
Emoji exist in various genres, including facial expressions, common objects, places and types of weather, and animals.
They are much like **emoticons**, except **emoji** are **pictures rather than typographic approximations**; the term "emoji" in the strict sense refers to such pictures which can be represented as **encoded characters**, but it is sometimes applied to **messaging stickers** by extension.
Originally meaning pictograph, the word emoji comes from Japanese e (絵, 'picture') + moji (文字, 'character'); the resemblance to the English words emotion and emoticon is purely coincidental.
The ISO 15924 script code for emoji is Zsye.
