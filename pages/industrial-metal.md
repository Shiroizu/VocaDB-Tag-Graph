#Genres

Industrial metal is a genre that fuses Metal with elements from Industrial Music. To the usual metal instrumentation, industrial metal adds Electronic instruments such as synthesizers, samplers and sometimes drum machines. The guitar riffs are often downtuned and repetitive, which gives the music a machinal quality. Other common characteristics are distorted vocals and an abrasive sound.

Two important bands that helped define the genre in the late 1980s were Ministry and Godflesh. Godflesh drew inspirations from heavy sounds of early Swans and Whitehouse, while Ministry incorporated metal-indebted guitar riffs to its brand of industrial dance music. After breaking into mainstream alternative music with records such as Nine Inch Nails's Broken and Ministry's Psalm 69, it spawned additional popular bands such as Fear Factory and Strapping Young Lad.

The prominent influence of industrial metal yielded popular subgenres such as Cyber Metal and Neue Deutsche Härte through the 1990s and influenced many extreme metal acts such as Blut aus Nord, The Kovenant, and Samael as well.
