#Distribution

For songs that have *at least* one of the PVs blocked in *some* region, prohibiting viewers of said region to view the song.

On YouTube, it might not be clear whether the song is geo-blocked or not. "*Video Unavailable*" is one (unhelpful) example message.

To confirm that the video is geo-blocked, you can use VPNs, the YouTube API or external tools such as the [YouTube region restriction checker](https://polsy.org.uk/stuff/ytrestrict.cgi).

### **Even so, said PV should not be marked as unavailable.**
