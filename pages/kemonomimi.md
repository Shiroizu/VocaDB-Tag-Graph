#Themes

Literally "animal ears", kemonomimi refers to humanoid characters with a small amount of animal characteristics (such as ears, wings, a tail, etc). Note that the "animal" part is very important: if a character has wings because they're an angel, and *not* because they're birdlike, then they're not a kemonomimi.

This tag may be used for:

- kemonomimi voicebanks
- videos and albums depicting kemonomimis (be they original characters, official kemonomimi voicebanks, or kemonomimi designs of non-kemonomimi characters)
