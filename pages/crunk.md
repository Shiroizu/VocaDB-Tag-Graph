#Genres

Crunk music originates from the southern United States, particularly Memphis and Atlanta. Nearly all crunk music is heavily reliant on the beat, which unlike most Hip Hop is rarely constructed with samples. Instead, Roland TR-808 and 909 drum machines are employed along with aggressive, mid or high tempo stabs of synthesizer. The result is often energetic and dance-oriented in nature, which is enhanced by lyrics that directly address the crowd and give them directions. These lyrics are usually but not always shouted in an aggressive manner, further emphasizing the physical style of the music.
