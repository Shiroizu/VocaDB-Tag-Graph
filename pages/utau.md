#Vocalists

UTAU is a free (shareware) singing synthesizer similar to Vocaloid. Unlike for Vocaloid, UTAU users are able to create their own voicebanks.

This is the root tag for other UTAU-related tags.

Can be used for albums with primarily UTAU vocals and producers working extensively with the UTAU software. 

Using this tag for UTAU voicebanks is redundant and should be avoided.
