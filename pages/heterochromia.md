#Vocalists

This tag is used for voicebanks with two different eye-colors on their designs, albums with odd-eyed characters on their covers and songs that have odd-eyed characters in their MVs.

Heterochromia is a difference in coloration, usually of the iris but also of hair or skin. Heterochromia of the eye is called heterochromia iridum or heterochromia iridis.
