#Themes

From Wikipedia:
>**Independent music (often referred to as indie music or indie) is music produced independently from commercial record labels or their subsidiaries, a process that may include an autonomous, do-it-yourself approach to recording and publishing.** The term indie is sometimes used to describe a genre (such as indie rock and indie pop), and as a genre term, "indie" may include music that is not independently produced, and many independent music artists do not fall into a single, defined musical style or genre and create self-published music that can be categorized into diverse genres.

"Indie", as a thematic tag, refers to two main ideas:
- songs or albums that are made by independent (indie) bands
- songs or albums that *sound* like they were made by indie bands

The latter is rather open-ended, so you'll have to use your own judgement as to what qualifies as "indie" or not.
