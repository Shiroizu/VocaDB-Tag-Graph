> _Alstroemeria_, commonly called _the Peruvian lily_ or _lily of the Incas_, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Alstroemeriaceae. They are all native to South America although some have become naturalized in the United States, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, Madeira and the Canary Islands. Species of Alstroemeria from Chile are winter-growing plants while those of Brazil are summer-growing. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alstroemeria))
