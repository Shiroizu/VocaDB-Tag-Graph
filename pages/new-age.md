#Genres

>New Age is a marketing term used for various forms of soft, melodic, instrumental music, often intended for relaxation or "easy" listening. It tends to be made with synthesizers or digital keyboards, played in traditional styles (as a piano ordinarily would be), although it can lean toward the experimental as well. On the experimental side, it includes a broad range of ambient music, space music, field recordings of nature sounds (rainfall, lightning, trees rustling, animals, etc.), and may feature chanting or drone noises. However, it almost always emphasizes tonal sounds and a lead melody. Strong modal harmonies may be present. It does not resemble dance music and is usually made by people with no connection to underground or even mainstream dance scenes.
