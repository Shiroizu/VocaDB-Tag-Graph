#Derivative

Amane Mono is a genderswap based on [Amane Luna](https://vocadb.net/Ar/26670).

Mono's voice is achieved by applying the parameter g+20 to any voicebank of [Amane Luna](https://vocadb.net/Ar/26670).
___
Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
