#Genres

>Hard dance is a cross-over genre between hard house, Eurodance and hard trance. This first appeared in the UK around 1998-99. Unlike the classic hoover sound of hard house and the rolling basslines, hard dance incorporates strong synths, percussion and echo effects from eurodance and a lot of pitched up trance music and is generally regarded as happier sounding music than pure hard house.
