#Genres

>Speedcore is a form of hardcore that is characterized by a high tempo and aggressive themes.
Aside from the very fast tempo of speedcore, which rarely drops below 300 bpm, speedcore can often be distinguished from other forms of hardcore by an aggressive and overridden electronic percussion track that is often punctuated with hyperactive snare or tom-tom fills.
The Roland TR-909 is often the drum machine of choice for speedcore producers due to its ability to generate heavily distorted bass-drum kicks that anchor the percussion tracks.
Most producers will often overdrive their kicks so much that they become square waves, much like in gabber, giving Speedcore its distinctive pounding sound.
The amen break is frequently used in a similar way to jungle music.
In particular, the snare is often played tens of times per second via a sampler, which can also be used to pitch the snare up and down quickly.
