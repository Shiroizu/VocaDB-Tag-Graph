#Animation

Design for the Synthesizer V [D-Lin](https://vocadb.net/Ar/119025) created by the group [VIMALION PROJECT](https://vocadb.net/Ar/110180).

Illustration by [rice](https://vocadb.net/Ar/69939) from the [VIMALION website](https://vimalion.pro/).

>   An intimidating man who seems hard to get along with. Despite his scary face, he's actually quite mild-mannered.
