#Derivative

Mostly for fanmade (unofficial) Vocaloid voice configurations.

By default, derivative characters (fanmade or official) without their own voicebank should be indicated with tags instead of artist entries.

___

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
