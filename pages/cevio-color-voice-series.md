#Vocalists

Color Voice Series is a project by [JOYSOUND](http://vocadb.net/T/3118/joysound).

Each CeVIO corresponds to a colour (red: Akasaki Minato, green: Midorizaki Kasumi, gold: Kinzaki Koharu, silver: Ginsaki Yamato, white: Shirosaki Yuudai, yellow: Kizaki Airi). Each CeVIO represents a genre or several genres: Midorizaki represents 60s/70s J-Pop, Akasaki represents rock, Kizaki is RnB and other genres, Kinzaki seems to be enka. They are more retro and old-fashioned than traditional Vocaloids, more like [Kaito](http://vocadb.net/Ar/71) and [Meiko](http://vocadb.net/Ar/176), and like them, the Color Voice Series characters are older and have more mature voices than average Vocaloids.

The sale was discontinued on January 14, 2022.
