#Derivative

**Weird Rei** is a derivative of [Adachi Rei](https://vocadb.net/Ar/74389). Although her first appearances date to May 2024, she was fully inaugurated by [n0ah](https://vocadb.net/Ar/138853) in October 2024 to accommodate Adachi Rei's 5th birthday.
She is a duplicate of Adachi Rei, except she is a "aesthetic warning floptok slay queen", that has 5 inch orange shiny nails-on-fleek nails (she wears daily, even when asleep), and only likes her orange glittery purse that she uses for "slaying".
Her surname (あだち) is spelled in Hiragana instead of Kanji, as she wears a jacket that says "あだちレイです" on the left of it.
She as well dislikes the original Adachi Rei, whilst every Utauloid ultimately despises Weird Rei for her plethora of unethical & disrespectful actions for her lifetime.

Her phrases are "あだちレイです" (Adachi Rei Desu), "Nahhh Hacking Ohhh", and as well "I'm Rei". She is only capable of talking in nothing but a mixture of the Floptok & Dana Saud dialects of English.
