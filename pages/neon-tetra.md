> The _neon tetra_ is a freshwater fish native to blackwater and clearwater streams in the Amazon basin of South America. Its bright colouring is the main reason for its popularity among freshwater fish hobbyists, with _neon tetras_ being one of the most widely kept tropical fish in the world.
The _neon tetra_ has a light-blue back over a silver-white abdomen. It is characterized by an iridescent blue horizontal stripe along each side of the fish and an iridescent red stripe that begins at the middle of the body. The fish is partially transparent (including fins) except for these markings. During the night, the blue and red become gray or black as the fish rests. It reactivates once it becomes active in the morning. This peculiar change is due to the _neon tetras'_ capacity to change the color of its iridescent stripe in response to lighting conditions. In a light-adapted state it is blue-green, likewise in a dark-adapted state its color changes to indigo.
