> The art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable and appealing when displayed.
The arrangement of type involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line-spacing, and letter-spacing, and adjusting the space between pairs of letters. 
The term typography is also applied to the style, arrangement, and appearance of the letters, numbers, and symbols created by the process.
