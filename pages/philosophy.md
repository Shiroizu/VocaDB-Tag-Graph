#Themes

>Philosophy is the systematized study of general and fundamental questions, such as those about existence, reason, knowledge, values, mind, and language.
Such questions are often posed as problems to be studied or resolved.
Some sources claim the term was coined by Pythagoras ; others dispute this story.
Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument, and systematic presentation.
