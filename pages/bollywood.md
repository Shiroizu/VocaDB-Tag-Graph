Bollywood is a name for the Indian popular film industry, based in Mumbai (Bombay). Its films often incorporate music and dancing (a la a [musical](https://vocadb.net/T/1724/musical)), with inspiration taken from more traditional punjabi bhangra dancing.

> Hindi cinema, often metonymously referred to as Bollywood, and formerly known as Bombay cinema, is the Indian Hindi-language film industry, based in Mumbai (formerly Bombay), Maharashtra, India. The term being a portmanteau of "Bombay" and "Hollywood", Bollywood is a part of the larger cinema of India (also known as Indywood), which includes other production centers producing films in other Indian languages. -Wikipedia
