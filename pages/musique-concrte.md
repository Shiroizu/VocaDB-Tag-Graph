#Genres

Musique concrète is a specific form of Electroacoustic that deals with the manipulation of environmental sounds, which includes Field Recordings, natural sounds, and real-world noises, although the human voice (sung or in Spoken Word form), Animal Sounds, musical instruments, or any other acoustic or Electronic sounds can also be utilized. The raw material is arranged and modified using various techniques, such as speed and pitch alteration, rhythmization by looping or reversal, reverberation, layering, amplitude and frequency modulation, and timbre decomposition, among other historically tape-based sound manipulation techniques. Musique concrète works vary greatly sonically, from minimal Ambient-based soundscapes to noisy and dissonant ones to sustained Drone with sparse and scattered noises.
