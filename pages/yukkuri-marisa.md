#Animation

Yukkuri are chibi, disembodied head versions of various [Touhou](https://vocadb.net/T/431/touhou-project) characters. They're a highly in-depth fan creation, having detailed life cycles, personalities, and other such ecological curiosities.

[Female Voice 2 from the AquesTalk](https://vocadb.net/Ar/104088) [or SofTalk programs](https://vocadb.net/Ar/116103) is commonly used to voice Yukkuri Marisa. [Yukkuri Marisa](https://vocadb.net/Ar/120772), Female Voice 2's UTAU port, officially utilizes the meme; however, due to the general oddities of the voicebank, this tag may still be applied to it.

Much like [ALT](https://vocadb.net/T/9328/alt), this tag refers to a famous fan design/character that is more renowned than the voicebank it utilizes. This tag can applied to:
* Songs and albums that refer to Female Voice 2 (AquesTalk or SofTalk) as "Marisa" or "Yukkuri Marisa", or otherwise use Yukkuri Marisa to represent Female Voice 2
* Songs that use Yukkuri Marisa, the UTAU port, while utilizing the memetic imagery or similar
* Songs and albums that feature Yukkuri Marisa in their illustrations or animations
