#Genres

Jersey club (originally called Brick City club) is a style of electronic club music that originated in Newark, New Jersey in the early 2000s.
It was pioneered by DJ Tameil and other members of the Brick Bandits crew, who drew direct inspiration from Baltimore club's hybrid of house and hip hop.
