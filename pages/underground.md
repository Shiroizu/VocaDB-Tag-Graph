#Genres

Underground music comprises musical genres beyond mainstream culture. Any song that is not being legally commercialized is considered underground.

Underground music may tend to express common ideas, such as high regard for sincerity and intimacy, freedom of creative expression as opposed to the highly formulaic composition of commercial music, and appreciation of artistic individuality as opposed to conformity to current mainstream trends.
