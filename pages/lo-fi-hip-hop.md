#Genres

From Wikipedia:
>Lofi hip hop (also known as "chillhop" and "lofi beats to study to") is a form of downtempo that combines elements of hip hop and chill-out music. It was popularized in the 2010s on YouTube and became an Internet meme.

Art by [きり∞ゆるふわ](https://piapro.jp/Kiri_03). It was inspired by [Lofi Girl's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJ4gkVC6NrvII8umztf0Ow) famous illustrations depicting a girl cozily studying as lo-fi hip hop songs played.
