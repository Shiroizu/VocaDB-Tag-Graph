#Themes

- Ape: A large primate that lacks a tail, including the gorilla, chimpanzees, orangutan, and gibbons
- Monkey: A small to medium-sized primate that typically has a long tail, most kinds of which live in trees in tropical countries

In traditional and non-scientific use, the term "ape" excludes humans, and can include tailless primates taxonomically considered monkeys.
