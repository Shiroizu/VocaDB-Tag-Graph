#Derivative

Tonarine Sai is a character referred to as a "Human Vocaloid", whereas her songs are sung by a human but modified to sound like a Vocaloid. Despite this, her voice is sometimes a piched-up version of Hatsune Miku's voice. Her initial voice provider and creator are noted to only be presumed as a user named "mother". Her illustrator is also unnamed, but most images are recolors of KEI's art for Hatsune Miku's Vocaloid2 design.

Sai's name is derived from the Japanese phrase "隣の騒音がうるさい" ("the noise of the neighbor is annoying and loud"). "Tonari" comes from the word for "neighbor", with "ne" meaning "sound". "Sai" is derived from "urusai", which can mean "you're being too loud!" or "shut up!".
