#Themes

From Wikipedia:
> In video games, a boss is a significantly powerful non-player character created as an opponent to players. A fight with a boss character is commonly referred to as a boss battle or boss fight. Boss battles are typically seen as dramatic events. As such, they are usually characterized by cutscenes before and after the boss battle and unique music. Recurring bosses and final bosses may have their own specific theme music to distinguish them from other boss battles.

Can be used for:
- Songs covering an existing boss battle theme
- Songs intended to sound like boss battle themes
