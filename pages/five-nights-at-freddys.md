From Wikipedia:
>Five Nights at Freddy's (FNaF) is an American media franchise created by Scott Cawthon. It began with the 2014 video game of the same name and has since gained worldwide popularity.
The main series consists of nine survival horror video games taking place in locations connected to a fictional family pizza restaurant franchise named "Freddy Fazbearâ€™s Pizza", after its mascot, the animatronic bear Freddy Fazbear. In most games, the player assumes the role of a night-time employee, who must utilize tools such as security cameras, lights, doors, and vents to defend themselves against hostile animatronic characters that inhabit the locations. The series' lore is gradually revealed through voice recordings, minigames, and easter eggs featured throughout the games.
