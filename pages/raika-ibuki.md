#Derivative

Raika Ibuki is a female configuration of [Raika Hibiki](https://vocadb.net/Ar/44550)'s voicebank achieved by setting the gender factor to -30. She is said to sound similar to [Kagamine Rin](https://vocadb.net/Ar/14), hence the nickname "Rinpoid" (りんっぽいど).

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
