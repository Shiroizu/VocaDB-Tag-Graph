#Derivative

**Naitou Anato** is the VOYAKILOID subderivative of [Megurine Luki](https://vocadb.net/T/6421), and the genderswap of [Naikou Ana](https://vocadb.net/T/10243). He was created by Benzarro85 in 2023.

He was created as a product of what genderswapped VOYAKILOIDs would be. He is based on the concept and creation of [Yowane Hakuo](https://vocadb.net/T/10253) and [Honne Deruko](https://vocadb.net/T/10464).
