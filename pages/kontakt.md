#Sources

KONTAKT is a software sampler distributed by the German company Native Instruments. It acts as a platform for a wide variety of synthetic instruments, including vocal synthesizers; while not an engine itself, many single bank engines utilize KONTAKT as a base. KONTAKT PLAYER is the freeware version of KONTAKT; notably, any software built for KONTAKT PLAYER will also work with KONTAKT, but this doesn't work in reverse. Both KONTAKT PLAYER and KONTAKT can be used as a stand-alone instrument or as a plug-in (VST/AU/AAX) to a digital audio workstation.
