#Vocalists

>Cross Synthesis (クロス-シーサセス), often shortened in reference to "XSY", is a parameter that allows a voicebank to blend into another voicebank, in a gradual and progressive way.
-- from Vocaloid Wiki

Supported by certain [Vocaloid3](http://vocadb.net/T/475/vocaloid3) and [Vocaloid4](http://vocadb.net/T/2995/vocaloid4) voicebanks, generally between variations of the same voicebank. Voicebanks must be of the same language. Vocaloid3/4 voicebanks by Internet Co. and AHS (except Kaai Yuki V4) are able to be cross synthesized with other voicebanks by the same company. 

#### Usage instructions

* Songs confirmed to be making significant use of cross synthesis.
* Albums with multiple cross-synthesized songs.
* Voicebanks that officially support cross synthesis.

As both characters are distributed by [INTERNET Co.](https://vocadb.net/Ar/29), the two can be cross-synthesized together legally.
