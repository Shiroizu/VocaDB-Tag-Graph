#Genres

>Latin music (Música latina in Spanish and Portuguese) is a genre that is used by the music industry as a catch-all term for any popular music from Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking areas of the world (including Spain and sometimes Portugal). In the United States, the term is used by the music industry to denote any music that is mostly sung in Spanish regardless of genre or the artist's nationality
