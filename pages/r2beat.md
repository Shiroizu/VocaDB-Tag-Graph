R2BEAT is a PC-compatible online rhythm game in which characters wearing inline skates compete while clearing obstacles.
It is a combination of racing and music games.

In Korea, the game launched in 2005 and one year later in Japan (October 5, 2006).
The Japanese version stopped updates of the in-game music on June 26, 2008 (additional music was added around May 2009 again).
The game service was suspended on September 9, 2009 in Japan and on December 10, 2013 in Korea.

On November 18, 2021, the open beta of a new version started in Korea.
