#Vocalists

The Sharpkey Galaxy, or SK Galaxy, was a world-facing project created by Boxstar in the begining of October 2017. The goal of the project was attracting experiencied talents in a virtual singer production and/or operations to develop virtual singers powered by the Sharpkey engine collectively. Anyone could apply to have their character become a Sharpkey; just needed to follow the requirements to make the application.
In total, only four vocals were released through the project; a few instead were released as DeepVocal banks after the engine upgrade. The characters went through the project were, in order:

- [**Lian Hua**](https://vocadb.net/Ar/95047);
- **Feng Qing Wakasame** (cancelled);
- [**Yong Qi**](https://vocadb.net/Ar/65277);
- [**Rabia**](https://vocadb.net/Ar/67272) (passed on to DeepVocal);
- [**Namine Ritsu**](https://vocadb.net/Ar/90742) (passed on to DeepVocal);
- [**Akane Inari**](https://vocadb.net/Ar/68031);
- [**Suoyun Rila**](https://vocadb.net/Ar/69927).

The SK Galaxy Project was replaced by the International Virtual Singers Project, a closed beta for DeepVocal that had the same objective and anyone could participate too. The IVSP was discontinued with DeepVocal's release, as the program was fully open to everyone from the start.
