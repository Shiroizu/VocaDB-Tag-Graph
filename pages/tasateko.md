#Derivative

Tasateko is a derivative/fanloid of Kasane Teto. Her voice is just Teto's UTAU standard library, except 2-3 pitches up or down from C4, when tuning her the pitch bends should be chaotic and wobbly.

Tasateko is a disgusting dumb gremlin. Made for the purpose of memes, and only exists to tell people to, "stop fucking around."

She has deep-rooted hatred towards Shiteyan'yo, and a love for cheese. Tasateko hates the way cheese tastes however she has a huge collection of cheese on her yacht. Her yacht is always floating in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, she does not use it unless it is to see or add to her cheese collection
