#Distribution

From the Vocaloid Wiki (Fandom):
> The VOCALOID-P data series (VOCALOID3 ボカロPデータシリーズ) were CD packs containing the data for songs by different producers.
> The packs were intended to act as a starter pack as well as a method of obtaining the official versions of each song that were used in the works of producers. [...] 
Naturally, one could not use these files for commercial use without permission of the original producer. However, they could be used for private and non-commercial use. You will also need the VOCALOID3 software, either full or tiny, to be able to use these packages.

>
> These products became subject to retirement as part of the VOCALOID3 product renewal and were due "SE" versions, but were never re-issued.

This tag is for:
+ Producers who have made their vocal data available for said vocal data series.
+ Songs which vocal data was available to purchase and get through said vocal data series.

The image used is the first out of four volumes released as part of the data pack series.
___
**Please set the vocal data provider to the artist who originally made the song, if the vocal data from a certain cover, remix, or drama PV is stated to come from this pack.**
