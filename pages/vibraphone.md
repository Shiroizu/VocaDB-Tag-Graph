#Instruments

The vibraphone is a mallet percussion instrument consisting of metal bars arranged like a keyboard. Compared with the [glockenspiel](https://vocadb.net/T/9869/glockenspiel), it's larger and plays at a written pitch. It also has resonator tubes like the [marimba](https://vocadb.net/T/4977/marimba), but the difference is the vibraphone has a flat metal disc inside each tubes that spin if turned on, which gives the vibraphone its signature vibrato effect.
