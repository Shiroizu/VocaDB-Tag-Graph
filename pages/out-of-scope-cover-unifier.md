#Editor_notes

Out-of-scope songs added to VDB only to act as the root item to group up together numerous Vocaloid and UTAU covers of that song (minimum of 5).

**Please do not make out-of-scope artist entries for cover unifier works.** If none of the artists are in scope, use the [Temporary artist](https://vocadb.net/Ar/139625) entry and then replace it with any necessary custom artist credits.
