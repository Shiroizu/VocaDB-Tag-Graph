RPG Maker is an ongoing series of video game engines created by the Japanese group ASCII (later succeeded by Enterbrain). While originally intended to help in the creation of RPGs, the vast majority of RPG Maker games are actually a particular form of horror adventure game.

This tag is for songs/PVs which were made using RPG Maker.  it may also be applied to artists who frequently use it in their works.
