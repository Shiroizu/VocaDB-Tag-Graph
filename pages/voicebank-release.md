#Vocalists

A root tag for the program-specific voicebank release tags. As certain programs (UTAU, DeepVocal, NNSVS, etc.) allow for user-created voicebanks, many banks end up releasing alongside a corresponding video.
This may currently be used if a release video does not have an accurate program-specific voicebank release tag.
