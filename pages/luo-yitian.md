For songs or albums that explicitly define the use of the derivative, Luo Yitian. Luo Yitian is a derived voice configuration for the VOCALOID, [Luo Tianyi](http://vocadb.net/Ar/1778).

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
