#Instruments

The harpsichord is a keyboard instrument that produce sound by plucking its metal wires with a complex mechanism. Unlike its descendant, the [piano](https://vocadb.net/T/337/piano), the harpsichord has wooden body and may has more than one keyboard and stop buttons like the [organ](https://vocadb.net/T/327/organ). It has smaller relatives, such as the virginals, muselar, and spinet.

Although it almost completely disappears in 19th century, being largely displaced by the piano, the harpsichord is revived back since 20th century. The largest models has 5 octaves range (F1 to F6), though it's usually tuned a semitone lower than modern tuning (following the tuning system used in the Renaissance and the [Baroque](https://vocadb.net/T/7730) era.)

The art is from [Marry me, Girl](https://vocadb.net/S/75312).
