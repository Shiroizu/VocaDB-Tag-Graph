#Themes

>Alchemy is an ancient branch of natural philosophy, a philosophical and protoscientific tradition that was historically practiced in China, India, the Muslim world, and Europe.
In its Western form, alchemy is first attested in a number of pseudepigraphical texts written in Greco-Roman Egypt during the first few centuries CE.

>Alchemists attempted to purify, mature, and perfect certain materials.
Common aims were chrysopoeia, the transmutation of "base metals" into "noble metals"; the creation of an elixir of immortality; and the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease.
The perfection of the human body and soul was thought to result from the alchemical magnum opus ("Great Work").
The concept of creating the philosophers' stone was variously connected with all of these projects.
