>"**Reincarnation**, also known as **rebirth** or **transmigration**, is the philosophical or religious concept that the non-physical essence of a living being begins a new life in a different physical form or body after biological death.
**Resurrection** is a similar process hypothesized by some religions, in which a soul comes back to life in the same body.
In most beliefs involving **reincarnation**, the soul is seen as immortal and the only thing that becomes perishable is the body.
Upon death, the soul becomes **transmigrated** into a new infant (or animal) to live again.
The term transmigration means passing of soul from one body to another after death."
