>NovelAI is an online cloud-based, SaaS model, paid subscription service for AI-assisted storywriting and text-to-image synthesis, originally launched in beta on June 15, 2021, with the image generation feature later implemented on October 3, 2022.
NovelAI is operated by Anlatan, based in Delaware.
[...]
>NovelAI uses a custom implementation of the source-available Stable Diffusion text-to-image diffusion model that is specifically trained on a Danbooru-based dataset to generate images from text prompts, and GPT-based models to generate storywriting prose.
There is also the ability to generate a new image based on an existing image.
The NovelAI terms of service states that all generated content belong to the user, regardless if the user is an individual or a corporation.
Anlatan states that generated images are not stored locally on their servers.
