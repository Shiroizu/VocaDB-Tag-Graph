#Derivative

A genderswap of [Kokone Kitty](https://vocadb.net/Ar/98911).

A black cat that was founded alongside "Kitty Kokone" who turns out to be her twin brother.
Despite being twins they are both the 'same age' being born the 'same time'.
He's the quiet to the point where he normally doesn't talk since Kitty does it for him.
Only can be heard 'singing', hardly talking.

Official voice settings are:
=> An octave down
=> g+15 / g15

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
