#Vocalists

>VCV-E, or VCV Extended, is a VCV multi language voice bank style. It is a VCV extension of the CV-C multi-language style. It uses principals from CVVC style banks (Like CV-C and VCCV) and VCV voice banks to make a large VCV bank that can sing multiple languages, including English. VCV-E is capable of singing faster songs while being less fragmented than CVVC style banks. VCV-E is easier to make usts for, and provides the natural note variation that CVVC style banks can't replicate .
