#Genres

"Plunderphonics is a term invented by John Oswald in his essay, Plunderphonics, or Audio Piracy as a Compositional Prerogative, and refers to the compositional technique of utilising and manipulating one or more pre-existing audio sources to create a new composition. It is an Experimental form of sound art that uses similar techniques found in Sound Collage. Where plunderphonics differs from sound collage is usually in the execution/composition and the end result's links to more traditional music genres. A plunderphonics song could essentially be a soundscape of assorted layered samples in the same way a sound collage piece is put together; it could just as easily be a rhythmic Electronic piece made up entirely of pre-existing materials, such as is heard on The Avalanches' Since I Left You." - rateyourmusic
