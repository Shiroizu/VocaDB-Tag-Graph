#Sources

An umbrella tag for all original fan works. Not for direct covers of songs from various media; for instance, a cover of YOASOBI's ["Idol"](https://vocadb.net/S/492341) would not count as a "fan song" of *"Oshi no Ko"* due to the song originally being *from* the anime itself.

This tag may be directly attached to:
* original songs unofficially created as tributes to chosen work (i.e. Mcki Robyns-P's ["'Cause I'm a Liar"](https://vocadb.net/S/170411) is a fan song to [Danganronpa V3](https://vocadb.net/T/86/danganronpa))
* non-original songs that originally had nothing to do with a chosen work being altered in such a way to act as a tribute to it
* fan animated PVs designed as a tribute to a chosen work
* albums designed as a tribute to a chosen work (i.e. ["Ano Hi Mita Mou Hitotsu no Hana no Namae"](https://vocadb.net/Al/1542), which is a tribute to the anime *[AnoHana](https://vocadb.net/T/8113/anohana)*)
