#Genres

Bedroom pop is a lo-fi music genre that blends elements of pop, soul, jazz, and indie pop. Also sometimes included are elements from the synthesizer-driven sound of synth-pop, the reverbed sound of dream pop, and the smooth, nocturnal atmosphere of trip hop.

Bedroom pop is also referred to as music that sounds like it was made in a low-quality environment, such as a musician's bedroom.
