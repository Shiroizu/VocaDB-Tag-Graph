Started by  [阿佐木 千夏](https://x.com/Chinatsu_YASAI/status/1473270315304501249) on X (formerly Twitter). The meme is a picture of [Hiroyuki Nishimura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroyuki_Nishimura) edited to have a thicker neck and wide shoulders, with the caption being  "データなんかねえよ" (Data Nanka nee yo, There's no data). The phrase is an edit of a famous quote by Hiroyuki; "なんかそういうデータあるんですか？" .

There is a variant of this meme called DATA*74, where users make [MADs](https://vocadb.net/T/1701) and parodies of mainly [DECO*27](https://vocadb.net/Ar/45), and other producers, songs. It started with a MAD of [Coward Mont Blanc](https://vocadb.net/S/1268) by NicoNico user [ロジィ](https://www.nicovideo.jp/user/124536014).
