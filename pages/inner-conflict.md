#Themes

Valid for:

- Songs that seem to tell of an inner conflict of the vocalist
- Songs which contain lyrics that might be interpreted as a conflict between two or more undefined characters with different points of view, but are sung by the same vocalist and cannot be told apart for sure
- Songs where the vocalist sings of two opposite points of view at the same time
- Albums that contain a large amount of such songs
- Artists who often produce such songs
