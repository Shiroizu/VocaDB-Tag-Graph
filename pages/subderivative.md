#Derivative

> A Subderivative is a Fanloid character based on an existing Fanloid character that was based on an official Vocaloid or some other character.
This is what the Fanloid Wiki uses to classify characters that have these origins, anything outside of the wiki can not be spoken for.
And like derivative there can be difficulties when trying to label such characters that, while inspired by a Fanloid, are not directly based on existing Fanloid physically but may have similar clothing or name.

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
