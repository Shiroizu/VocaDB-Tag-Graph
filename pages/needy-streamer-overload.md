*NEEDY STREAMER OVERLOAD* (original title: *NEEDY GIRL OVERDOSE*) is a 2022 denpa-themed adventure visual novel created by Japanese developer Xemono and published by WSS Playground for macOS, Microsoft Windows, and Nintendo Switch. The player takes on the role of a manager for a female livestreamer, making decisions for her so that she can achieve her goal of reaching one million followers within a month. The game was initially titled Needy Girl Overdose, but this was changed in November 2021 in preparation for the western release. The game kept its original title in Japan.
