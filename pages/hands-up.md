#Genres

A Eurodance movement that evolved mainly in Germany during blends of Eurodance, Trance and Happy Hardcore. It's phatt and usually uplifting.

From [Wikipedia]():
> Hands up (sometimes stylized as Handz Up! or HandzUp!, also known as Dancecore in East Europe) is a subgenre of eurodance. The genre comes from its name, meaning music that requires listeners to "put their hands up" as well as fitness and danceability. [...] The synthesizer melodies are often catchy and simple. Often the vocal melody is accompanied by a synthesizer. In contrast to Uplifting Trance, short, high-pitched synthesizer tones are used. Hands Up does not rely on the structure of tension build-up, but is based on the typical verse-chorus-pop music scheme. The main elements are the bassline, drums and a catchy lead sound. A typical stylistic device of hands up are pitched female or resulting feminine vocals, male vocals are also common. In addition, distorted, chopped and repeated spoken phrases are common characteristics.
