#Sources

Applies to albums by single music producer/circle (__does not apply to singers' best albums__).

Greatest hits albums (AKA "best of" album or ベストアルバム/"best album" in Japanese) feature the most notable songs by artists -- in all time of their activity or in several years. Such albums are often released under music labels and can be purchased from big online stores.
