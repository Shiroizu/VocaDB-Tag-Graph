#Vocalists

LaLaVoice is a vocal synthesizer created by Toshiba in 2001. The software is available for Windows 98, Me, 2000, and XP. The software uses a sheet music layout as opposed to the piano roll used by most other synthesizers. The software is capable of speech through TTS, but could also input sounds via a microphone. There are 9 voices available. 6 of them are based off of realistic members of a family, a male and female counterpart of a child, an adult, and an elder. The other 3 are based on robots. It is also possible to "create your own vocalist" from the 9 existing voices. One of LaLaVoice's main functions was to read aloud web pages and emails. The software also had compatibility with Microsoft office and had a schedule management program with a mascot called Super Mimi (すぅぱぁみみ, suupaamimi). The software could be bought individually or is included with Toshiba's DynaBook PC.
