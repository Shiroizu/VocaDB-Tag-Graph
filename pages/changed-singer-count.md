#Vocalists

A tag for covers or remixes where a different count of voicebanks is used compared to the original, i.e. a [duet](https://vocadb.net/T/3180/duet) to a single singer, or a [trio](https://vocadb.net/T/6650/trio) to a [nonet](https://vocadb.net/T/7275/nonet). 
**Note: This tag only applies to the main vocals (i.e backing vocals do not add to the total singer count)**

This tag also does not generally apply to mashups, as mashups A: generally work with more than one source song, thus making it hard to determine the original singer count; and B: have an [applicable child tag](https://vocadb.net/T/1524/awasetemita) for single source singer-count-changing works.
