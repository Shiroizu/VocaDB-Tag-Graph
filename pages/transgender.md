#Themes

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender):

>Transgender people have a gender identity or gender expression that differs from their sex assigned at birth. [...] Transgender – often shortened as trans – is also an **umbrella term: in addition to including people whose gender identity is the opposite of their assigned sex (trans men and trans women), it may include people who are not exclusively masculine or feminine** (people who are non-binary or genderqueer, including bigender, pangender, genderfluid, or agender).

This tag applies to:

* Songs and albums that prominently feature characters that are transgender
* Songs and albums that are thematically related to trans topics or issues (such as [gender dysphoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_dysphoria), [transitioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitioning_(transgender)), etc.)
* Artists who frequently make songs with these subjects.
* Canonically transgender voicebank characters.
