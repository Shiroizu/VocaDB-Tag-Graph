#Derivative

For albums and songs that explicitly define the usage of the derivative, **MEITO**.

MEITO is a voicebank configuration of the VOCALOID [MEIKO](http://vocadb.net/Ar/176). He is the male genderswap version of her.

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
