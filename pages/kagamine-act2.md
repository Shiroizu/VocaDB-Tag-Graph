#Vocalists

For songs that use [Kagamine Rin](http://vocadb.net/Ar/14)'s and [Kagamine Len](http://vocadb.net/Ar/15)'s Act2 - as opposed to Act1. Act2 was made as an improvement on the original product, which is referred to as Act1. It has a clearer sound and better pronunciation.

This tag is only to be used for:

* Upgraded versions of songs when a previous version synthesized using Act1 exists. The [upgraded voicebank](http://vocadb.net/T/6333/upgraded-voicebank) tag can be applied as well.
* Demo songs for Act2.

**Do not** use this tag for other Act2 songs.
