>A stick figure, also known as stickman, is a very simple drawing of a person or animal, composed of a few lines, curves, and dots. On a stick figure, the head is most often represented by a circle, sometimes embellished with details such as eyes, a mouth, or hair.
The arms, legs, and torso are usually represented by straight lines.
Details such as hands, feet, and a neck may be present or absent; simpler stick figures often display an ambiguous emotional expression or disproportionate limbs.
