#Derivative

>A [Hatsune Miku-like](https://vocadb.net/Ar/1) [Vocaloid](https://vocadb.net/T/4857/vocaloid), known as an "Annoyloid," a parody character intended to poke fun at bad designs by the "weeaboo" users. She was created by [sango312](https://vocadb.net/Ar/13510) (original recolor and configuration) and [mystsaphyr](https://vocadb.net/Ar/13192)/[UTAUxyz](https://vocadb.net/Ar/15826) (Kamui Gakupo voice suggestion and backstory).

>Kagami Kawaiine uses [Kamui Gakupo's](https://vocadb.net/Ar/12) voice configurations, but with intentionally distorted parameters. Kagami's typical vocal setting is Gakupo at g5 with the pitch edited so severely to be off-key and full of over exaggerated vibrato.

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
