#Genres

From [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/J-core):
>J-core is the style of hardcore techno associated with Japanese groups and DJs from the 1990s onward. It is marked by its usage of samples derived from video games and anime, colorful kawaii imagery and album graphics, and the general borrowing of elements from denpa and otaku culture. J-core music is often found in rhythm games, and forms a substantial part of the doujin music scene.
