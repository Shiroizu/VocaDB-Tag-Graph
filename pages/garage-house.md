#Genres

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garage_house):
>Garage house (originally known as "garage music"; also "New York house") is a dance music style that was developed alongside house music. Garage, which had a more soulful R&B-derived sound was developed in the Paradise Garage nightclub in New York City and Club Zanzibar in Newark, New Jersey, United States, during the early-to-mid 1980s. It predates the development of Chicago house, and according to All Music, is relatively closer to disco than other dance styles. In comparison to other forms of house music, garage is more polished, and it includes gospel-influenced piano riffs and female vocals.
