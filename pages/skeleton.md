From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton):
>The skeleton refers to the frames of support of animal bodies. There are several different skeletal types: the exoskeleton, which is the stable outer shell of an organism, the endoskeleton, which forms the support structure inside the body, the hydroskeleton, a flexible skeleton supported by fluid pressure, and the cytoskeleton present in the cytoplasm of all cells, including bacteria, and archaea. The term comes from Greek σκελετός (skeletós) 'dried up'.
