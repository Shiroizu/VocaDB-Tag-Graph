#Instruments

*A nine-string guitar is a guitar with nine strings instead of the commonly used six strings. Such guitars are not as common as the six-string variety, but are used by guitarists to modify the sound or expand the range of their instrument.*
(from Wikipedia)

The nine-string guitar can be divided into two common styles.

***Coursed strings***
*The first style is often employed with three pairs of coursed strings similar to a twelve-string guitar. Often the three wound strings are single and the three thin strings are doubled to six strings. This allows dry power chords on the lower three and a more atmospheric chorus sound when all strings are played.*

***Extended range***
*The second style expands on the seven- and eight-string guitar concept by adding either an additional lower- or higher-tuned string. When a lower string is added, the standard tuning becomes C#, F#, B, E, A, D, G, B, E. The scale is often lengthened, e.g., on the Ibanez RG9 (712 mm/28" instead of the common 25.5").*

The nine-string guitar shown in the photograph is WintermintP's Legator Artist Signature LM-9 Lucas Mann signature guitar. It has a 30"-28.5" multiscale. The version that he currently owns initially had EMG 909X pickups installed on it at the time of this photo. As of this edit, he installed an AB220 preamp on the guitar, along with new limited run Guitarmory Atlas pickups. He currently owns an extra pair of the Atlas pickups he is saving up for another guitar.
