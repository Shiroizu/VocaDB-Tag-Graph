>In Chinese philosophy, wood, sometimes translated as Tree, is the growing of the matter, or the matter's growing stage.
Wood is the first phase of Wu Xing.
Wood is the lesser yang character of the Five elements, giving birth to Fire.
It stands for springtime, the east, the planet Jupiter, the color green, windy weather, and the Azure Dragon (Qing Long) in Four Symbols.
