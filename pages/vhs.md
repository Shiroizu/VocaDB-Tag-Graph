The VHS (Video Home System) is a standard for consumer-level analog video recording on tape cassettes, introduced in 1976 by the Victor Company of Japan (JVC). It was the dominant home video format throughout the tape media period in the late 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. - [Wikipedia (EN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHS)
