#Derivative

Nakeka Claude is a derivative of Kakune Shanon with a slightly cuter sound. She can be made by setting Shanon's gender flag to anywhere between g-4 and g-15.

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
