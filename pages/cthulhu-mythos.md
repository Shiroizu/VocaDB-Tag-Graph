#Copyrights

Created by author H.P. Lovecraft, the Cthulhu Mythos refers to the pantheon of gods that he created, the most famous of which is Cthulhu. Cthulhu is a "Great Old One", an overwhelming powerful cosmic entity that lurks beneath the sea. While the Mythos was started by a single person, it has been continued and codified by many other people; Cthulhu in particular has appeared in a wide variety of media, including even comedy and romance.

This tag is for entries that explicitly draw upon the Cthulhu Mythos, be that Cthulhu himself, another god, or even the Necronomicon.
