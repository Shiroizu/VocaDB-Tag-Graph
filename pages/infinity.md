#Series

Vocaloid Hatsune Miku, was bought and installed by "Master", who she cared for deeply. However, over time she begins to wonder about the reason she was born, much to the opposition of her other shadows (Appends).  - [Vocaloid Wiki](https://vocaloid.fandom.com/wiki/%E2%88%9E_-InfinitY-_(Series)#See_also)

The series has a few different endings, and is connected to other cosMo song series. It's also the source of the popular [Infinity Miku](https://vocadb.net/T/9752) design.
