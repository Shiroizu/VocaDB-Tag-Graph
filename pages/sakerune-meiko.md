#Derivative

Sakerune Meiko is a Heavy Metal version of Vocaloid Meiko. Her surname 裂音 (Sakerune) means "Splitting Sound" or as the creator seems to put it, "Splital Music". It should be noted that she is not related to, nor be confused with her other much younger Meiko's version, Sakine Meiko. Although their surname name pronunciations are identical, it's the Kanji characters in the family name which offsets them.

Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
