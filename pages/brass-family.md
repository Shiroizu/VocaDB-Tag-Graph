#Instruments

The brass family of musical instruments consists of instruments made from metal (usually brass) that produce sound when the player buzzes their lips into a mouthpiece. These instruments can change pitch by adjusting the lip tension, valve or slide positions, and air pressure. They are known for their bright, bold sound and are often used in orchestras, bands, and brass ensembles.
