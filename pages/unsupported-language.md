#Vocalists

Songs where a voicebank sings in a different language than the one it's intended to be used in.

Please note that this does not apply to voicebanks that support multiple languages singing in their intended languages. For example, [Megurine Luka](https://vocadb.net/Ar/2) has both English and Japanese voicebanks - this tag would not apply if her English voicebank was used in an English song, but it would apply if her English voicebank was used in another language.
