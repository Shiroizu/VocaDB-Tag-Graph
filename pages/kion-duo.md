#Derivative

**Kion Duo** is the Fanloid derived from the VOCALOID1 [LEON](https://vocadb.net/Ar/386), by Zero-G Ltd.. He was originally created by Wyrvvn (Crossfrown) in 2009.

He is portrayed as a 12-year-old boy with serious temper issues and has a habit of judging people on their sense of fashion.

Kion's character item are voodoo dolls, but he both likes and is designed after dragon fruit.

His voice is very high and whiny.

Kion hates most people, especially Leon, though often time Leon seems to be oblivious of the boyâ€™s hatred for him.
