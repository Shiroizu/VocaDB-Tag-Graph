> Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA 2nd (初音ミク -Project DIVA- 2nd) is a 2010 rhythm game created by Sega and Crypton Future Media for the PlayStation Portable.
The game is a sequel to the 2009 video game, Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA, and was first released on July 29, 2010 in Japan with no international release.
Like the original the game primarily makes use of Vocaloids, a series of singing synthesizer software, and the songs created using these vocaloids most notably the virtual-diva Vocaloid Hatsune Miku.

> Similar to Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA, a companion game for the PlayStation 3, Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Dreamy Theater 2nd, was released digitally via the Japanese PlayStation Store on August 4, 2011.
Like its predecessor, the game features updated high-definition visual improvements over its respective PSP game while featuring the same content and PlayStation Trophies support, and requires the player to connect the PSP (with Project DIVA Extend) to the PS3 via USB to access the content in the game.
