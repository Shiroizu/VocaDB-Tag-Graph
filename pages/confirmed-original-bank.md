#Editor_notes

This tag should be used when it is **confirmed** that an artist used the original bank of a character. For example, [this cover](https://vocadb.net/S/293620) states that it utilized Hatsune Miku's v2 bank, and thus it qualifies. This tag is redundant for songs and albums made before a character received multiple banks (i.e. IA songs from before June 27th, 2014 do not need this tag).

When it is unknown as to which particular bank was used, please set the earliest bank and add the [unspecified voicebank](https://vocadb.net/T/2982/unspecified-voicebank) tag instead.
If a user can infer as to what bank was used, please add the [unconfirmed vocalists](https://vocadb.net/T/6416/unconfirmed-vocalists) tag instead.
