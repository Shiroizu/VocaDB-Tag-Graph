#Event

A collaboration between Pokémon and Hatsune Miku that asks the question “What if Hatsune Miku was a ___-type Pokémon trainer?” 

Starting September 29th, 2023, 18 new songs by 18 different Vocaloid producers, in reference to there being 18 different types of Pokémon, will be sequentially released. Each song will feature samples from the Pokémon series, with background music and sound effects from the franchise incorporated into the new tracks. 

Between September 4th to 28th, 2023, one new illustration was revealed every day on social media, illustrated by 6 different artists.

On March 9, 2024 after the final of the 18 songs was released, it was announced that there would be an additional 19th song. On May 10th, 2024 after the additional 19th song was released, it was announced that there would be another additional 20th song along with a music CD containing all the collaboration songs. The name of the project has not changed, however.
