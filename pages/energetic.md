#Subjective

The opposing tag to [calm](https://vocadb.net/T/50/calm). Energetic songs are bouncy and upbeat, often designed to get the listener's blood pumping. This may come from a strong focus on up-and-down rhythm patterns, speedy lyrics, an uptempo beat, or even just a general driving force to the song.

Illustration by [Sisyou](https://vocadb.net/Ar/45077). It depicts [Rana](https://vocadb.net/Ar/23600) as she happily sits upon a brightly-coloured disco ball, her legs mid-kick and her hair mid-bounce. She's against a [neon-saturated](https://vocadb.net/T/9442) background, surrounded by [stars](https://vocadb.net/T/3053/stars), [macarons](https://vocadb.net/T/6605/macaron), and [bunnies](https://vocadb.net/T/3494). Note the exuberant energy in the piece.
