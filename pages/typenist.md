#Games

Typenist was an unofficial online Vocaloid rhythm game released on August 30, 2008. It is notable as the earliest Vocaloid rhythm game, as well as the one with the largest soundtrack, with a total of 1,152 songs released over the game's lifespan.

The game's online servers were shut down on January 22, 2011. An offline version, Typenist Single, was released on August 10, 2012 exclusively at Comiket 82.

*Editor's note: This tag is based on archival information and will likely remain incomplete, as a significant number of song confirmations from the game's last year have not been preserved.*
