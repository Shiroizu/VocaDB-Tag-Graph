> _Nihon no Uta Hyakusen_ (_日本の歌百選_, "_collection of 100 Japanese songs_") is a selection of songs and nursery rhymes widely beloved in Japan, sponsored by the Agency for Cultural Affairs and the Parents-Teachers Association of Japan. A poll was held in 2006 choosing the songs from a list of 895. The results were announced in 2007. Although it is called a compilation of 100 songs, the list actually includes 101 songs.
