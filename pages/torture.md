#Themes

This tag typically applies to songs featuring characters that depict torture, the deliberate infliction of severe pain or suffering on a person, often for reasons such as punishment, extracting confessions, obtaining information through interrogation, or intimidating others.

It also covers various methods of torturous capital punishment from the past, as well as murders where the victim was subjected to torture prior to death, such as those associated with Elizabeth Bathory.
