#Vocalists

*From Synthesizer V Wiki:*
>...[Ddickky](https://vocadb.net/Ar/16527) confirmed that the Plus series of voice databases were created with the intention of demonstrating the effects of training AI with Standard voice databases and were not meant to be released. The voice databases were sent to shareholders as a technology demonstration and not as a full product update. As these voice databases were to show the effects and technology of splicing AI training, they could not be noted as "Synthesizer V AI" as they would affect the brand quality of AI voice databases, thus the need of calling these "Synthesizer V Plus".
