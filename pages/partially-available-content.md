#Editor_notes

This tag should be applied to works that are only partially available (or artists whose works are only partially available). 

Examples of partially available content:
* Only a clip of the song exists
* Only the audio is available
* Only very limited content can be traced back to the song

Keep in mind that some sort of content must be available; entries with no available content do not count.
The artwork is one of the images used in the song "[潮騒に砂は哭く　～ Siren～](https://vocadb.net/S/440420)" by Dr.Willy, itself a partially available song. Artwork by GY0YU (https://piapro.jp/content/flxoyo3klkv1mhmy)

Videos that are **fully** available, but exclusively through reprints, can be found by using [search filters](https://vocadb.net/Search?searchType=Song&advancedFilters[0][description]=No%20original%20media&advancedFilters[0][filterType]=HasOriginalMedia&advancedFilters[0][negate]=true&advancedFilters[0][param]=&advancedFilters[1][description]=Standalone%20(no%20album)&advancedFilters[1][filterType]=HasAlbum&advancedFilters[1][negate]=true&onlyWithPVs=true).
