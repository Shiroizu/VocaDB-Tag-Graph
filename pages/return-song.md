#Editor_notes

For songs published as a "return" to vocal synth work by the producer, even if for only that song.
This includes:
- Songs published after a lengthy hiatus (at least 2 years)
- Songs published after an announced hiatus (Example: [JimmyThumbP](https://vocadb.net/S/3195))

If a producer takes frequent breaks/hiatuses, this tag should only be applied to the most significant of them.
