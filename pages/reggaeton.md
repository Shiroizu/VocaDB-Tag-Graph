#Genres

Reggaeton originates from 'Reggae en Español' (Spanish reggae), which was the Afro-Panamanian version of reggae and dancehall. Vocals include rapping and singing, typically in Spanish. The dembow drum pattern is based on the track "Dem Bow" by Shabba Ranks, which was adopted and repurposed by reggaeton producers in many of their songs.
