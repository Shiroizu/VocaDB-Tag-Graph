#Themes

A traditional style in Japanese culture comparable to double-act comedy or stand-up comedy.

Manzai usually involves two performers (manzaishi)—a straight man (tsukkomi) and a funny man (boke)—trading jokes at great speed. Most of the jokes revolve around mutual misunderstandings, double-talk, puns, and other verbal gags.

The illustration is by [和田ケニチ](https://piapro.jp/wadan).
