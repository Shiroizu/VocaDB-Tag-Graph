#Genres

>Synth-pop is a music genre that first became prominent in the late 1970s and features the synthesizer as the dominant musical instrument. It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in progressive rock, electronic, art rock, disco, and particularly the Krautrock of bands like Kraftwerk. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the post-punk era as part of the new wave movement of the late 1970s. (From Wikipedia)

Synth-pop primarily uses synthesizers (polyphonic or monophonic synth) and drum machines. Other common elements include complementary electric guitar licks, funky basslines (often played on a synthesizer), and pulsating drum machine patterns.
