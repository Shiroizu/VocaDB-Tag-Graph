#Sources

Yuzuki Yukari Μμ (結月ゆかりΜμ) is [Chihiro Ishiguro](https://vocadb.net/Ar/53358)'s virtual, 2.5D Vtuber (Vsinger) persona. Yuzuki Yukari Μμ is not a vocal synth software, but rather Chihiro Ishiguro's own vocals made to sound "machine-like".

Yuzuki Yukari Μμ is an "officially unofficial" project by VOCALOMAKETS, who allowed the use of Yuzuki Yukari's likeness but are otherwise uninvolved. Yukari Μμ was designed and illustrated by LAM.

The Yuzuki Yukari Μμ project started through a crowdfunding campaign held by Ishiguro herself on CAMPFIRE, the campaign goal was to be able to held real-time live concerts, livestreams and VR live concerts using her Yukari Μμ persona, and to create original music for her.

Songs created for the Yuzuki Yukari Μμ project often have versions with VOCALOID/CeVIO Yuzuki Yukari.
