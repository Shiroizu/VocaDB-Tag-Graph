#Animation

Popular design for [VY2](http://vocadb.net/Ar/118) by [hatahiro](https://vocadb.net/Ar/2569). 66 was originally submitted to Everyone's Vocaloid Project (みんなのボカロ計画) as a potential new Vocaloid, but instead was nominated as a semi-official VY2 design.

According to the creator, 66 should be regarded as an image character voiced by VY2, so they should **not** be treated as fully interchangeable (e.g. 66 is not Yuuma, and VY2 is not automatically 66). He has also appeared as a character in the original manga *Ukare Bakemono no Hogaraka na Hatan*.

* For albums and songs where 66 appears.
