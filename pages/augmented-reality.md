Augmented reality (AR) is a live direct or indirect view of a physical, real-world environment whose elements are augmented (or supplemented) by computer-generated sensory input such as sound, video, graphics or GPS data.
Source: Wikipedia

The difference between augmented reality and match moving is that augmented reality is live (the computer graphics are added in real time) while match moving means post processing.

This tag is can also be used for PVs that have AR as a theme.
