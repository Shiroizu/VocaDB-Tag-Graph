AZO-BA (Azzie) was created by a scientist/roboticist as a gift to his only child Maria. Since the father mostly worked all day at the laboratory and didn't really spend time with his child. So he created a robot that resembled his child. The robot was very childish, adorable, and friendly anthropomorphic bear cub. The child, Maria, loved and cherished the robot very much. Until the "incident" occurred. Leaving Maria lost in a "parallel world." Maria's father tries countless times to fix this but it always ends with failure. Eternally feeling that he would never get his child back. He threw everything that made him remember his child including the robot. The robot thrown away for years rusting over time felt that it was the end, but then a young roboticist found him. They fixed the robot and restored him to the adorable bear cub he was before. They also gave him a singing voice to entertain the people with wonderful songs.

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
