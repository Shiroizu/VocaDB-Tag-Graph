#Jobs

#### Definition
Music Producers are artists whose main roles are to compose or arrange music, including both original music and derivatives such as covers and remixes. Voice manipulation (Vocaloid/UTAU tuning) is included.

#### Tag usage
This tag can be manually applied as a secondary type for artists whose main role is something other than producing music. This tag is unnecessary if the artist type is "Music producer".
