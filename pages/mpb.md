#Genres

**MPB** (acronym for *Música Popular Brasileira*) is a Brazillian musical genre that was born as a successor of [bossa nova](https://vocadb.net/T/46/bossa-nova), initially mixing it with the musical moviments of *National Union of Students* (despite both being very different). Due the historical context in which emerged, it immediately got a strong fighting character against the military regime that was establish in 1964.
The MPB music began with a markedly nationalist image, but it has been changing and incorporating elements from various origins; this diversity is even hailed as one of the hallmarks of this musical genre.
