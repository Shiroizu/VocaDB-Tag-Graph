#Animation

Design for the Synthesizer V [Eri](https://vocadb.net/Ar/125668) created by the group [VIMALION PROJECT](https://vocadb.net/Ar/110180). Illustration by [rice](https://vocadb.net/Ar/69939) from the [VIMALION website](https://vimalion.pro/).

 > A refreshing, my-pace gyaru whose mood can flip at the drop of a hat. Tends to be a bit my-pace, but her expressiveness is charming. \- [VIMALION website](https://vimalion.pro/eri)
