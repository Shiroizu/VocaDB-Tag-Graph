#Languages

> Japanese is spoken primarily in Japan, the only country where it is the national language.
Japanese belongs to the Japonic or Japanese-Ryukyuan language family.
*-Wikipedia*

Primarily used to mark songs and albums where the Japanese vocals are somewhat unusual or unexpected. That is, songs and albums with Japanese vocals sung by a voicebank that is not designed for Japanese.

Voicebanks that are designed to sing in Japanese should be tagged with this tag.

Tagging songs / albums should be avoided if the voicebank language is already obvious (this rule is different from other language tags, such as English).
