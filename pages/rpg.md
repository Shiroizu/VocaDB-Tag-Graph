#Themes

Short for "role-playing game", RPGs are exactly that: games where you 'roleplay' a character. RPGs are often story-heavy, either featuring a set protagonist or one who the player completely creates.  They may control a single character or a whole party, and said party could be player-made or not. RPGs instead consustently feature level up systems, where players can select abilities or paths as their characters level up.

For entries that specifically reference table-top RPGs, please see the [corresponding tag](https://vocadb.net/T/9568/tabletop-rpg).
