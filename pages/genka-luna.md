#Derivative

A derivative of [Genka Reita](https://vocadb.net/Ar/78752). Her voice is achieved by setting up a g-15 flag on Reita's voicebank.

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have their own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank (e.g. Hatsune Miku).
