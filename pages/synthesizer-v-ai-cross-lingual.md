#Vocalists

Introduced in [Synthesizer V Studio Pro](https://vocadb.net/T/7524/synthesizer-v-studio) version 1.5.0, this feature allows AI voicebanks to read **Japanese**, **English**, and **Mandarin Chinese** phonemes, regardless of their original recording language. **Cantonese** and **Spanish** support followed in versions 1.9.0 and 1.11.0, respectively.

[Synthesizer V Studio 2 Pro](https://vocadb.net/T/11382/synthesizer-v-studio-2) version 2.0.0, expanded this to **Korean**.

Note that the Language field of voicebanks should still be labelled with the languages they were recorded for, instead of the languages this feature allows.
