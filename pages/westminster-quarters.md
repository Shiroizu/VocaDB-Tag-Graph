#Composition

From Wikipedia:
> The Westminster Quarters are sounded by four quarter bells hung next to Big Ben in the Elizabeth Tower belfry in the Palace of Westminster. Most schools in Japan and Taiwan play the chimes to signal the end and beginning of classes.

Use this for songs that incorporate the melody.
