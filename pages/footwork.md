#Genres

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footwork_(genre)):

>The music style has evolved from the earlier, rapid rhythms of juke and ghetto house, a change pioneered by R.P. Boo. It may draw from styles such as drum and bass, utilizing double-time clave triplets, syncopated toms and prominent sub-bass. Tracks also frequently feature heavily syncopated samples from rap, pop, and other sources, and are often around 160 bpm. Footwork also includes techno influences from Detroit; an example of this is in artist Jlin's music. The influences of techno on her work are present in her use of high-pitched synths, standard bass lines and hand claps. Footwork also incorporates the club culture cultivated in disco, house and techno. Much like in techno, footwork is about the "aesthetic of anonymity" but its status as an international genre was boosted by artists like the late DJ Rashad. Sampling is a key part of footwork. Most modern footwork draws on funk and soul basslines through their work.
