From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerPoint):
>Microsoft PowerPoint is a presentation program, created by Robert Gaskins and Dennis Austin at a software company named Forethought, Inc.
It was released on April 20, 1987, initially for Macintosh computers only.
Microsoft acquired PowerPoint for about $14 million three months after it appeared.
This was Microsoft's first significant acquisition, and Microsoft set up a new business unit for PowerPoint in Silicon Valley where Forethought had been located.
