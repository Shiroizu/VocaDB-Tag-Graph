* Artists who are known to act regularly as VJs.

___

>VJing is a broad designation for realtime visual performance.
Characteristics of VJing are the creation or manipulation of imagery in realtime through technological mediation and for an audience, in synchronization to music.
VJing often takes place at events such as concerts, nightclubs, music festivals and sometimes in combination with other performative arts.
This results in a live multimedia performance that can include music, actors and dancers.
The term VJing became popular in its association with MTV's Video Jockey but its origins date back to the New York club scene of the 70s.
In both situations VJing is the manipulation or selection of visuals, the same way DJing is a selection and manipulation of audio.
