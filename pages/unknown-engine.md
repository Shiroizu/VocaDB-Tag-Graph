#Vocalists

For voicebanks that belong to an unknown engine. 

If the bank itself *is* the engine, then please use the [voicebank-as-engine](https://vocadb.net/T/10630/voicebank-as-engine) instead.

Not to be confused with [unspecified voicebank engine](https://vocadb.net/T/9027/unspecified-voicebank-engine), a tag for songs and albums that utilize an character without any acknowledgement of the engine.
