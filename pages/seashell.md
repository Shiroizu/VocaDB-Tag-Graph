> Bivalvia in previous centuries referred to as the Lamellibranchiata and Pelecypoda, is a class of marine and freshwater molluscs that have laterally compressed bodies enclosed by a shell consisting of two hinged parts.
As a group, bivalves have no head and they lack some usual molluscan organs, like the radula and the odontophore.
The class includes the clams, oysters, cockles, mussels, scallops, and numerous other families that live in saltwater, as well as a number of families that live in freshwater.

*-Wikipedia*

> A seashell or sea shell, also known simply as a shell, is a hard, protective outer layer usually created by an animal or organism that lives in the sea.
The shell is part of the body of the animal.
Empty seashells are often found washed up on beaches by beachcombers.
The shells are empty because the animal has died and the soft parts have decomposed or been eaten by another animal.
