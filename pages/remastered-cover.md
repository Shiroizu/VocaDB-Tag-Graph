#Sources

This is very specifically for a remastered and/or redone version of an earlier cover. This is *not* a tag for remasters of original songs that just happen to also act as a (self-)cover. 
Please put the previous cover -- if we have a link to it -- in the external links section, and the original song in the original song section. Make sure to mark the entry type as a "cover" too. 
Thank you.
