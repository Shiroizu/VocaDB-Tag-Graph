#Derivative

Ryukka is a derivative of Megurine Luka created by [Makarafa-P](https://vocadb.net/Ar/43189). She is a small version of Luka with a higher pitched voice.

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have their own voice. It's only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
