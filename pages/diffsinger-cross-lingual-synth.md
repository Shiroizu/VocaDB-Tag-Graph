#Vocalists

A feature of **DiffSinger** that allows its voicebanks to sing **in different languages regardless of what language the voicebank was recorded in**.

Languages such as Japanese, English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, Thai, Polish or Brazilian Portuguese are being developed and available to use with this feature.

>**Note that the Language field of voicebanks should still be labelled with the languages they were recorded for, instead of the languages this feature allows.** Due to DiffSinger being open-source, different creators may not always detail the language(s) they recorded for, but when that information is known, recorded language(s) should be clearly separated from languages that are supported thanks to this feature.
