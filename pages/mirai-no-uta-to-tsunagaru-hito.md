#Games

未来の歌と、つながるヒトミ (Mirai no Uta to Tsunagaru Hitomi) was a visual novel released at September 2009 by Supplement Time. Unlike its [two](https://vocadb.net/T/9665) [predecessors](https://vocadb.net/T/9666), this game features a completely new protagonist with a different Hatsune Miku. Also, Kagamine Rin and Len, Megurine Luka, KAITO, and MEIKO all appeared in a particular scene. It borrowed several music tracks from Niconico with the producers' permission.
