#Editor_notes

This tag is for songs that have multiple versions uploaded **within a week.**

When dealing with the simultaneous upload of **a vocal synth version** and **a human version**, the vocal synth version should be marked as the "original", unless otherwise indicated by the artist. 

As an example, the [Hatsune Miku version of Raspberry ＊Monster](https://vocadb.net/S/28549) is counted as an original on this site, even though  [a human version](https://utaitedb.net/S/1073) was uploaded on the same day (Jun 06, 2013).

If the (official) human-sung version is published **more than a week before** the voice synth version, the song entry should be marked as "cover", and tagged with the [self-cover -tag](https://vocadb.net/T/391/self-cover) intead.

In all the cases, the human-sung version should be specified in the **song description** or in the **external links**, along with its **publish date**.

If the (official) human-sung version is published **more than a week after** the voice synth version, the human-sung version **can be mentioned** as usual, but neither of the two tags should be added.

These rules **do not apply** to cases where **both songs have entries** on VocaDB. In this case the standard rules apply for choosing the original version: Select the entry with the earliest publish date, unless otherwise specified by the artist.
