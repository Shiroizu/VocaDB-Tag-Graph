#Genres

>Experimental electronic music with acoustic instrumental leads. Not an officially defined genre, but commonly used as a blanket term for unique fusion music of electronic and classical elements.
...its fast beats and complicated melodies have made it very popular in rhythm games such as Osu. Made by xi, ICE, Sakuzyo, occasionally by Yooh, and a few other, mostly Japanese composers. A pretty good pick for anyone who likes classical music but thinks it lacks power, or people who like DnB but think it lacks melodic variety. Sometimes combined with speedcore or trance.
