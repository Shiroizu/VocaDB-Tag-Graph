#Vocalists

Trial voicebanks are freely available versions of paid voicebanks. These are released to allow users to 'demo' a voicebank that they may wish to buy without having to actually buy it first. Since these are free, trial banks are often only usable for a short period of time upon download, while others have particular limitations on their usage instead. Some trials are only given a limited release, while others are available year-round on the main shop.

This tag may be used for:
* songs that utilize trial banks
* albums with multiple songs that utilizes trial banks
* voicebanks with trial versions

Note: While there can be overlap, trial voicebanks are not necessarily the same as [beta voicebanks](https://vocadb.net/T/34/beta-voicebank), which are for voicebanks still undergoing development. Trial versions can also be available for voicebanks that are otherwise completed or commercially available.
