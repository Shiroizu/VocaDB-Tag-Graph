#Vocalists

A budget pack of voicebanks with upgraded configurations released by Crypton on August 30, 2024.

> This SUPER PACK brings six virtual singers together: "MEIKO", "KAITO", "HATSUNE MIKU", "KAGAMINE RIN/LEN", and "MEGURINE LUKA". This package includes one Japanese vocal library of each singer. From the iconic voice of "HATSUNE MIKU", which has adorned numerous songs, to the fresh and energetic "KAGAMINE RIN/LEN", the husky and glamorous "MEGURINE LUKA", the powerful and mature "MEIKO", and the vibrant male vocals of "KAITO", you can seamlessly switch between or combine these voices to create various vocal and chorus arrangements.
