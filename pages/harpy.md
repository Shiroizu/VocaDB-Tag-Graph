#Themes

>In Greek mythology and Roman mythology, a harpy is a half-human and half-bird personification of storm winds.
They feature in Homeric poems.
Harpies were generally depicted as birds with the heads of maidens, faces pale with hunger and long claws on their hands.
Roman and Byzantine writers detailed their ugliness.
Pottery art depicting the harpies featured beautiful women with wings.
Ovid described them as human-vultures.

Art by [oice](https://piapro.jp/oice). It depicts [Hatsune Miku](https://vocadb.net/Ar/1) as a harpy in mid-flight, her arms leading to feathered wings and her twintails flowing through the air.
