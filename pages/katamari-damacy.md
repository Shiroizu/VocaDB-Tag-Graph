#Copyrights

Katamari Damacy is a 3D puzzle-action game franchise created by Keita Takahashi and developed/published by Namco. 

After the King of All Cosmos accidentally destroys all the stars in the sky in a drunken stupor, he orders his incredibly tiny son, the Prince of All Cosmos, to roll up lots of increasingly large objects into balls called "katamari", to be made into new stars and constellations.
