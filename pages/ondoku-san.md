#Vocalists

A free AI text-to-speech app available for commercial use. Ondoku will read aloud up to 5000 characters worth of text for free (more text can be read via subscription plans), which can then be downloaded as MP3s. A wide variety of languages are supported with many voices therein to choose from.

The exact release date of this app is currently unknown, as are the release dates for most voicebanks.
