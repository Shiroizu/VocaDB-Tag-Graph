#Themes

Guro is a Japanese term derived from the English word “grotesque”. It is a genre of art dealing with themes of gore, mutilation, disfigurement, extreme violence or something that's just weird beyond comprehension (though the last one is considered an archaic definition).

The art is by [神瀬 りの](https://piapro.jp/NakyuU).
