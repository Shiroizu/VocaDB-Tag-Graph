#Genres

>Tropical house is a subgenre of deep house, which is itself a subgenre of house music. Thus, it possesses typical house music characteristics, including synthesizer instrumentation, and a 4/4 kick drum pattern. Tropical house differentiates itself from deep house, which can often have a very dark sound, whereas tropical house can be described as having a more uplifting and relaxing sound. The tempo of tropical house songs is a little slower than deep house (110-115 bpm). Tropical house does not use the pumping compression effect of "big room" electro house. It usually includes tropical instruments such as steel drums, marimba, guitar, saxophone or even pan flute, like dancehall. (from Wikipedia)
