An upgrade to ChatGPT's image generation feature, which previously used OpenAI's DALL-E 3 model. Compared to DALL-E 3, OpenAI says that GPT-4o image generation boasts superior quality, prompt following, and text synthesis.

The icon was generated in the ChatGPT interface using the prompt "Hatsune Miku".
