#Genres

> Kawaii metal (also known as idol metal, cute metal, J-pop metal or kawaiicore) is a musical genre that blends elements of heavy metal and J-pop that was pioneered in Japan in the early 2010s.
The genre combines both Eastern and Western influences that appeal to both cultures.
A typical kawaii metal composition combines the instrumentation found in various types of heavy metal music with J-pop melodies and a Japanese idol aesthetic.
Kawaii metal's lyrical topics often contain kawaii (cute, lovable, kidlike) themes.

> The Japanese girl group Babymetal is often credited with the creation and success of kawaii metal.
