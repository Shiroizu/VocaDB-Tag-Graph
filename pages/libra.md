>Libra (♎︎/♎) is the seventh astrological sign in the zodiac.
It spans 180°–210° celestial longitude.
The Sun transits this sign on average between September 22 and October 23.
The symbol of the scales is based on the Scales of Justice held by Themis, the Greek personification of divine law and custom.
She became the inspiration for modern depictions of Lady Justice.
The ruling planet of Libra is Venus.
Libra is the only zodiac sign that is represented by an object; with the other eleven signs represented by either an animal or mythological character.
