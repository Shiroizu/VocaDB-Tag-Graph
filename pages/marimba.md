#Instruments

The marimba is a mallet percussion instrument consisting of wooden bars arranged like a keyboard. Compared to the [xylophone](https://vocadb.net/T/8068/xylophone), the marimba has larger and thicker bars, more subdued tone, and has resonator tubes. The marimba also has the largest range of all mallet percussion instrument, being the only one that can play in bass register; some models can reach as low as C2, two octaves below Middle C.
