#Derivative

Manida is a genderswap based on [Namida](https://vocadb.net/Ar/12998).

Manida's voice bank can be obtained by giving Namida a g+35 flag.

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
