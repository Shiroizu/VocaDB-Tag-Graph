#Genres

>Funk metal is a subgenre of funk rock and alternative metal which infuses heavy metal music (often thrash metal) with elements of funk and punk rock. Funk metal was part of the alternative metal movement, and has been described as a "brief but extremely media-hyped stylistic fad" --- from Wikipedia

Funk metal takes the loud guitars and riffs of heavy metal and melds them to the popping or slap bass lines and syncopated rhythms of funk.
