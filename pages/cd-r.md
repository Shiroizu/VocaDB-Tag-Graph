#Media

A compact disc-recordable (CD-R) is a digital optical disc storage format.
It is a compact disc that can only be written once and read arbitrarily many times.
Self-pressed CD-R discs are most commonly used by independent/doujin artists who publish albums at conventions instead of record stores.
A CD-R is colorful, showing green and blue hues due to different chemicals.

- For albums that were released as CD-R, as opposed to pressed CD (CD-ROM) or digital download.
