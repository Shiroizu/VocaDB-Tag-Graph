#Genres

>Progressive trance is melodious but without synth arpeggios & less vocals. With a beat and a bassline faster to the house (134-142 BPM), the songs are long and have an interesting construction where different elements are brought gradual and gentle way (hence the name of this style). (from Discogs)
