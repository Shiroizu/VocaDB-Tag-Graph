A compact disc-read only memory (CD-ROM) is a pre-recorded disc that contains data or software that cannot be altered or erased. 
CD-ROMs are typically mass-produced and distributed for commercial use.
A real CD (CD-ROM) made on a production line is silver colored.

- For albums that were released as CD-ROM, as opposed to CD-R.
