#Themes

> Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus.
An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion" (...).
When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage".
The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion.
