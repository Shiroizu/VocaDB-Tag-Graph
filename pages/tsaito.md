#Derivative

TSAITO is a derivative created by BlueHairP and the counterpart to Setsune Cele, often being portrayed as her lover. He is a derivative of KAITO and is often portrayed as a mech pilot. He currently has no official voice configuration.

He was previously known as "ZEIT" before his name was changed to avoid confusion with Zeito.
