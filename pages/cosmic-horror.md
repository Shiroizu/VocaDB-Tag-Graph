#Themes

Pioneered by author H.P. Lovecraft, cosmic horror (alternatively known as eldritch or Lovecraftian horror) is a form of horror that focuses on human powerlessness in comparison to an overwhelming, alien evil. The antagonists are often "indescribable", featuring appearances so bizarre and outside of the norm that they drive a person mad. Their view of humanity is that of apathy, since humans are nothing more than pebbles to an elder god.

This tag can be used for songs and albums that feature this as distinctive element; it may also be used for artists that regularly indulge in it, or voicebanks that purposefully riff on it.
