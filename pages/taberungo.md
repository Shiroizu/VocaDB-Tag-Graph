#Themes

A meme featuring Tsujino Akari from [The iDOLM@STER](https://vocadb.net/T/203/the-idolmster): Cinderella Girls, originally prompted by the song  [たべるんごのうた](https://vocadb.net/S/277588) by [バチ](https://vocadb.net/Ar/79672). Producers create covers of a wide variety of songs and insert lyrics about apples. Many of these videos use [Tohoku Kiritan's](https://vocadb.net/Ar/79466) NEUTRINO voicebank due to it being released for free around the same time.

While the original purpose of the meme was to raise the character's position in popularity polls, the novelty of a "classic" Niconico meme emerging in 2020 has attracted a broader nostalgia-based subculture, and crossover with old memes is common.
