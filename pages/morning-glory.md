#Themes

> _Morning glory_ (also written as _morning-glory_) is the common name for over 1,000 species of flowering plants in the family Convolvulaceae. As the name suggests, most morning glory flowers unfurl into full bloom in the early morning. They generally prefer full solar exposure throughout the day, however some morning glories are night-blooming flowers. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_glory))

Common meanings in floriography ([Flower Meaning](https://www.flowermeaning.com/morning-glory-flower-meaning/)):
* mortality of life;
* unrequited love, love that is in vain;
* restricted love (Chinese meaning symbolizing that lovers may only meet on one special day out of the year);
* willful promises ([hanakotoba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanakotoba)).
