#Themes

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT):
>LGBT (or GLBT) is an initialism that stands for **lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender**. [...] The initialism LGBT is intended to emphasize a diversity of **sexuality and gender identity-based cultures**. It may be used to refer to anyone who is **non-heterosexual or non-cisgender**, instead of exclusively to people who are **lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender**.

This tag applies to:

* Songs thematically related to LGBTQ+ subjects
* Albums thematically related to, or with a surplus of songs about, LGBTQ+ subjects
* Artists who produce songs with LGBTQ+ subjects
