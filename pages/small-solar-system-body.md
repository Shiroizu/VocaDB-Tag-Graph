A small Solar System body (SSSB) is an object in the Solar System that is neither a planet, a dwarf planet, nor a natural satellite. This encompasses all comets and all minor planets other than those that are dwarf planets.

- A minor planet is an astronomical object in direct orbit around the Sun that is neither a planet nor exclusively classified as a comet.

- Asteroids are minor planets, especially of the inner Solar System. Larger asteroids have also been called planetoids. These terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the Sun that did not resolve into a disc in a telescope and was not observed to have characteristics of an active comet such as a tail.

- A comet is an icy, small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun, warms and begins to release gases, a process called outgassing. This produces a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail.

- A meteoroid is a small rocky or metallic body in outer space. Meteoroids are significantly smaller than asteroids.

- A micrometeoroid is a tiny meteoroid: a small particle of rock in space, usually weighing less than a gram.

- A meteorite is a rock that originated in outer space and has fallen to the surface of a planet or moon. Meteorites are often remains of a meteor that has survived the ablation of its surface material during its passage through the atmosphere.
