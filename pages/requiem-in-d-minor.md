>"The Requiem in D minor, K. 626, is a requiem mass by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–1791). 
Mozart composed part of the Requiem in Vienna in late 1791, but it was unfinished at his death on 5 December the same year. 
A completed version dated 1792 by Franz Xaver Süssmayr was delivered to Count Franz von Walsegg, who had commissioned the piece for a requiem service on 14 February 1792 to commemorate the first anniversary of the death of his wife Anna at the age of 20 on 14 February 1791."

A number of alternative completions have been developed by composers and musicologists:
- Gabriel Fauré composed his Requiem in D minor, Op. 48, between 1887 and 1890.
