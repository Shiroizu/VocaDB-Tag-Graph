#Animation

In cinematography, match moving is a cinematic technique that allows the insertion of computer graphics into live-action footage with correct position, scale, orientation, and motion relative to the photographed objects in the shot.
Source: Wikipedia

Match moving is primarily a post-processing technique, as opposed to augmented reality, which is real-time.
