#Sources

This tag is for:
* Songs that are officially made for an anime series (e.g. [All Saints Street](https://vocadb.net/S/276555))
* Songs used in anime, even if originally made otherwise (e.g. [Otsukimi Recital](https://vocadb.net/S/25901))
* Original vocal synths songs that were then officially human-covered for an anime (e.g. [Kaguya](https://vocadb.net/S/414145))  
* OST albums (e.g. the [ClassicaLoid MUSIK Collection Vol.1](https://vocadb.net/Al/36292))
* Events where the prize is for the song to officially become part of the anime (e.g. the [OreImo song contests](https://vocadb.net/Es/334/oreimo-song-recruitment))

For songs that *cover* anime music, please use the [anime song cover](https://vocadb.net/T/22/anime-song-cover) tag instead.
