#Derivative

SAM WEIV is an official genderswap derivative for the UTAU [MIDI WEIV](https://vocadb.net/Ar/150389) by [ZSHTEASE-P](https://vocadb.net/Ar/88810).

SAW WEIV is based off of the synthesizer sawtooth waveform. This waveform is jagged and "hard" (not to be confused with triangle waveforms)

SAW's voice is grainy and robotic, he has more of an artificial sound to him.
He can handle low notes and middle range notes, but high notes begin to sound funny.
best range C2-C3.

SAW is also a pitch derivative of MIDI, but unlike SINE his voice is very limited. He can only be used in resampler and can't use all of the appends.

SAW has a calm and level headed disposition. He’s not much of a talker, but he enjoys writing music with his keytar and singing. Though he’s not the most sociable and outgoing of people, he makes up for that in fashion. Guaranteed to be the best dressed on and off the stage, stealing the spot light with his luxurious hair, mascaraed lashes, and high heeled boots. Over the years he managed to develop a habit of smoking, due to this his voice has become rough. Though not how he sounded originally, his post nicotine sound complements the smoothness of his appearance.

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
