#Genres

> _Neoclassicism_ in music was a twentieth-century trend, particularly current in the interwar period, in which composers sought to return to aesthetic precepts associated with the broadly defined concept of "classicism", namely order, balance, clarity, economy, and emotional restraint.
In form and thematic technique, _neoclassical_ music often drew inspiration from music of the 18th century, though the inspiring canon belonged as frequently to the Baroque and even earlier periods as to the Classical period — for this reason, music which draws inspiration specifically from the Baroque is sometimes termed neo-Baroque music.
