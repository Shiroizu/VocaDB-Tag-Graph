#Genres

Lo-fi (originally spelled low-fi [from the term "low fidelity"]) is an aesthetic of recorded music in which the sound quality is lower than the usual contemporary standards (the opposite of high fidelity) and imperfections of the recording and production are audible. These standards have evolved throughout the decades, meaning that some older examples of lo-fi may not have been originally recognized as such. Lo-fi only began to be recognized as a style of popular music in the 1990s - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo-fi_music)
