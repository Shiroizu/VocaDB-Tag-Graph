> Although _tree_ is a term of common parlance, there is no universally recognised precise definition of what a _tree_ is, either botanically or in common language. In its broadest sense, a _tree_ is any plant with the general form of an elongated stem, or trunk, which supports the photosynthetic leaves or branches at some distance above the ground.
