#Vocalists

While some tuners strive for realism, others utilize the electronic nature of vocal synths for a robotic feel. 

This tag is for:
* songs that purposefully tune and mix the vocalist to sound robotic in nature
* albums with predominantly robotic-sounding vocals
* voicebanks designed to sound robotic (many of which are [purely synthetic](https://vocadb.net/T/363/pure-synthetic-voice) in origin)
* artists that frequently tune and/or mix their vocals in a purposefully robotic way
