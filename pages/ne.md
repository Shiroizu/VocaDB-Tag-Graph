#Derivative

NE is a genderswap based on [MEGAne](https://vocadb.net/Ar/66131).

NE isn't by default, so you will need to add g-11 to get her.

Hair color: Long white hair fading to pink and later to lime green, straight fringe and often in a ponytail/bun
Eye color:Light pink
Shirt: A white armless longshirt with high neck, and pink lines along the edges
Jacket: A grey/black short jacket reaching to her waist
Sleeves: Long and wide, with a transparent pink broad line and speakers near the hands
Skirt: Black, short and puffy
Feet: Thigh-high black boots with same upper ends as on the jacket's arms, and pink soles
Other: Sometimes wears a piano key-patterned muffler with no ends, limegreen glasses and black/green headphones.
Also has two beautymarks below her right eye, matching her brother.
Nationality: Unknown

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
