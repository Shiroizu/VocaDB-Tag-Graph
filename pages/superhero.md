#Themes

"Superhero" is a character type and genre depicting someone with superhuman abilities (often referred to as "super powers") that can use them to fight crime. The most archetypal superhero wears brightly-coloured tights and a flowing cape, saving the day with their extraordinary abilities while keeping their secret, civilian identity under wraps. Superheroes are often associated with the Western comic book medium due to their ongoing popularity there; many of the most famous superheroes, such as Superman or Spiderman, originated in comic books.

While superheroes originated in the West, they have been growing popular elsewhere. Ignoring [magical girl](https://vocadb.net/T/6407/magical-girl) and super sentai shows -- which tend towards similar-ish plotlines but distinctively different aesthetics than superheroes -- the genre has been picking up steam in Japan with serieses like [My Hero Academia](https://vocadb.net/T/7022/boku-no-hero-academia) and [TIGER & BUNNY](https://vocadb.net/T/4754).
