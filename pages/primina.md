#Derivative

Primina is a derivative of the Vocaloid Prima that portrays her as a younger teenage Prima, or simply to represent Prima as a younger woman. Her design is widely recognized and is sometimes used to represent the nonderivative Prima.

She was created by Mameshiba.

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
