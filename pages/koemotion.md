Koemotion is a generative AI vocal synthesis and facial imagery engine developed by [rinna](https://vocadb.net/Ar/121293). It was fully launched on [June 12th, 2023](https://twitter.com/rinna_koemotion/status/1668177756482600963) and is available as a subscription service. By inputting numbers across a 4-sectioned grid and selecting the preferred emotion, users can generate corresponding vocals.
