MASSIVE TRIGGER WARNING: mentions of serial killers.

Bunreibakone Sukabu (分霊箱音スカッブ) is an original Fanloid created by Benzarro85 in 2023. Her voice is a low pitched [Fukase](https://vocadb.net/Ar/46458).

Sukabu is described as a stereotypical 2000's goth who loves listening to Linkin Park, among other heavy metal artists and groups. All of her clothes are black and silver, and she hates the colour pink.

She has no character item, but if she did, it would be a miniature black diary.

Sukabu is unfazed by the sight of blood or a dead body, and she is descibed to write letters to serial killers such as Jeffrey Dahmer and Ted Bundy. She describes them as mentally ill.

She has an older brother, who thinks she is a weirdo.
