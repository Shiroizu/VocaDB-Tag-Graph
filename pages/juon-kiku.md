#Derivative

A derivative of Hatsune Miku first used by pupupipu, representing Miku's "cursed" or "dark" side (but, contrary to some beliefs, not "yandere").
Her songs usually have discordant music, extremely distorted voice and dark backgrounds in videos.

Notable features:
- Color scheme: red (main color) and white (color of the outfit)
- Hair: straight, red
- Eyes do not have highlights ("rape eyes")
- Carries a Japanese nata hatchet
- Clothes expose belly button

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
