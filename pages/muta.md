#Vocalists

MUTA is a discontinued Chinese synthesizer developed by [厦门优他动漫科技有限公司](https://vocadb.net/Ar/120645). As a whole, the program had five vocals: [Yan Xi](https://vocadb.net/Ar/31234),  [Hupo Xu Yan](https://vocadb.net/Ar/67288), [Weiyang](https://vocadb.net/Ar/70862), [Liliko](https://vocadb.net/Ar/71156), and [Xin Ge Ping](https://vocadb.net/Ar/120551); the latter two were only available through the [mobile app](https://vocadb.net/T/9649/muta-app). Three more voicebanks had been announced ([Xi Sheng](https://vocadb.net/Ar/71205), [Li Xiang](https://muta.fandom.com/wiki/Li_Xiang), and [You Hui](https://muta.fandom.com/wiki/You_Hui)), but only Xi Sheng ever received demos. MUTA has since ended development.
