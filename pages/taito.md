#Derivative

Taito is a popular yandere derivative of the official Vocaloid Kaito. His name is simultaneously a pun on "Kaito" and a combination of the two kanji "帯 " ('belt' or 'sash,' used to make the word for 'bandage') and "人" ('person').

Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
