#Themes

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_tale):

> A fairy tale, wonder tale, magic tale, or Märchen is folklore genre that takes the form of a short story that typically features entities such as dwarfs, dragons, elves, fairies, giants, gnomes, goblins, griffins, mermaids, talking animals, trolls, unicorns, or witches, and usually magic or enchantments.
Fairy tales may be distinguished from other folk narratives such as legends (which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described) and explicitly moral tales, including beast fables.
The term is mainly used for stories with origins in European tradition and, at least in recent centuries, mostly relates to children's literature.
