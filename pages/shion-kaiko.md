#Derivative

A subderivative of KAITO and derivative of KAIKO created by the artist Brian Narita (ブライアン成田). Her design is closer to KAITO's original design, and was conceived as a fictional entry to Crypton's CV series.

Depending on the producer, she can be depicted as an alternate design of KAIKO, or a separate character; typically KAIKO's younger sister or cousin. Most Western fans regard her as the same character as KAIKO.

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
