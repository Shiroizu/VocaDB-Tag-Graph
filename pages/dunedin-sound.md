#Genres

The Dunedin sound refers to music created by a collective of bands from Dunedin, New Zealand beginning in the early 1980s.

>Dunedin sound "was typically marked by the use of droning or jangling guitars, indistinct vocals and often copious quantities of reverberation." Many Dunedin sound bands drew inspiration from punk rock, as well as pop, rock, and psychedelic music of the 1960s. (from Wikipedia)
