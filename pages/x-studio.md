#Vocalists

X Studio is a free, AI-implemented voice synthesizer developed by [Microsoft](/Ar/81711) China and [Xiaoice](/Ar/121501). Originally entitled StudioVoICE, the program launched on August 20th, 2020 with four voicebanks: [Xiaoice](/Ar/80162), [He Chang](/Ar/76473), [Chen Zi Yu](/Ar/81900), and [Chen Shui Ruo](/Ar/76408); the former three were all available prior as beta vocals. The program allows for people to create and add third party vocals through the [enrollment](https://www.xstudio.pub/about/enroll.html) system.

Please note that the vast majority of X Studio banks are only available with a Chinese phone number.
