#Vocalists

For songs that simulate the growl effect or use the official VOCALOID4 parameter. It may also refer to any vocals that sound raspy, growly, or with gutteral sounds.
Also used for voicebanks that officially support the use of growl such as voicebanks for the VOCALOID4 engine.

Th Growl (or GWL) parameter adds a hard tremolo or guttural effect to the voice, giving it a more aggressive or forced intonation, which adds expression to the tone of the vocal.

Growl is not necessarily exclusive to VOCALOID4 voicebanks or usages.
