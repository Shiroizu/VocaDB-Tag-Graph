#Composition

For songs where synthetic voices are used as a part of accompaniment.

Unlike [a cappella](https://vocadb.net/T/7), this tag does not imply that regular instruments are not used at all. It is also different from [scat singing](https://vocadb.net/T/3363) in the way that the latter is not used _instead of_ certain instruments but _along with_ them.

It also applies to all "instrumental" UTAU voicebanks ([Koumi Bass](https://vocadb.net/Ar/61185), [Koumi Voice Percussion](https://vocadb.net/Ar/61186) etc) and any songs involving them.
