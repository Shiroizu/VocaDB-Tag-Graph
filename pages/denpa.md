#Genres

Denpa (電波) is a Japanese word meaning "radio waves" but these days, it is specifically used to describe a relatively new genre of music emerging quasi-exclusively from Japan and covering some over genres like gamewave, [chiptune](https://vocadb.net/T/62/chiptune), [bitpop](https://vocadb.net/T/1575/bitpop), akibapop and to a certain extent, [JPop](https://vocadb.net/T/1654/j-pop). Denpa music tends [energetic](https://vocadb.net/T/9001/energetic), [catchy](https://vocadb.net/T/4564/catchy), and repetitive, with fast, nonsensical lyrics and wild melody lines.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denpa_song):
>Denpa song (電波ソング) is a type of Japanese music that is intentionally strange and catchy. Common features of denpa songs include intentionally off-key vocals, nonsensical lyrics and an over-the-top tune. Denpa music has grown into a subculture within Japan, forming a significant aspect of otaku culture and has large numbers of doujin circles and music artists dedicated to denpa music. Denpa is not a specific genre in itself, but rather an umbrella term for various kinds of music.
