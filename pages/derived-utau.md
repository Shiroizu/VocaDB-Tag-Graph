#Derivative

Fanmade UTAU voice configurations.

By default, derivative characters (fanmade or official) **without their own voicebank** should be indicated with **tags on the song**, not with a new artist entry. If they have their own voicebank, then this tag should still be added to their entry.
___
Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
