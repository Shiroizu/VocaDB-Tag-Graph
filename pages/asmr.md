A tingling sensation that typically begins on the scalp and moves down the back of the neck and upper spine. 
ASMR signifies the subjective experience of "low-grade euphoria" characterized by "a combination of positive feelings and a distinct static-like tingling sensation on the skin". It is most commonly triggered by specific auditory or visual stimuli.

- Use for songs or albums that include audio-sensory ASMR or for artists that typically produce ASMR content.
