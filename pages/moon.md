#Themes

Artists, albums, and songs thematically related to the satellite of the Earth, the Moon, and other natural satellites (moons).

The Moon is Earth's only proper natural satellite. At one-quarter the diameter of Earth, it is the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, and the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System overall.

A natural satellite, or moon, is, in the most common usage, an astronomical body that orbits a planet or minor planet.
