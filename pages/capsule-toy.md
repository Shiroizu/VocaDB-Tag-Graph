From [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_toy):
> A **capsule toy** _(カプセルトイ, kapuseru toi)_ is a type of small vending machine in Japan, in which a user inserts a coin and turns the rotating lever to receive a released toy in a capsule. Each vending machine contains several different items and one of them is randomly dispensed.

This tag is for songs and albums that predominantly feature or are thematically related to capsule toys, or characters that incorporate capsules into their design.
