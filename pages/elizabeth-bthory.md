From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Báthory):
>Countess Elizabeth Báthory de Ecsed (7 August 1560 – 21 August 1614) was a Hungarian noblewoman and convicted serial killer from the family of Báthory, who owned land in the Kingdom of Hungary (now Hungary, Slovakia)
>
>Báthory and four of her servants were accused of torturing and killing hundreds of girls and women between 1590 and 1610. Her servants were put on trial and convicted, whereas Báthory was confined to her home. She was imprisoned within Castle of Csejte.
>. . .
Stories about Báthory quickly became part of national folklore. Legends describing her vampiric tendencies, such as the tale that she bathed in the blood of virgins to retain her youth, were generally recorded years after her death and are considered unreliable. Some insist she inspired Bram Stoker's *Dracula* (1897), although Stoker's notes on the novel provided no direct evidence to support this hypothesis. Nicknames and literary epithets attributed to her include *The Blood Countess* and *Countess Dracula*.
