#Vocalists

Synthesizer V (also known as SynthV) is a vocal synthesizer created and developed by [Dreamtonics](https://vocadb.net/Ar/76460).

Mostly used for albums with primarily Synthesizer V vocals and producers working with the Synthesizer V software. Also used for producers frequently using Synthesizer V.

Using this tag for Synthesizer V voicebanks is usually redundant and should be avoided.
