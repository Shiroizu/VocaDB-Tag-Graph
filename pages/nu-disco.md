#Genres

>Nu-disco (sometimes referred to as disco house or electro-disco) is a 21st-century dance music genre associated with a renewed interest in 1970s and 1980s disco, early to mid-1980s Italo disco and French house, as well as other synthesizer-heavy European dance styles.

[Illustration](https://piapro.jp/t/rjlP) by [malta](https://vocadb.net/Ar/117096). It depicts a [bikini](https://vocadb.net/Ar/2)-clad [Megurine Luka](https://vocadb.net/Ar/2) as she sings and dances, pointing to the audience. The disco ball in the background spins and lights up the floor and walls. Note the anachronism of the piece, bringing older elements of disco (the disco ball) and more modern features (the bikini) together, much like nu-disco itself.
