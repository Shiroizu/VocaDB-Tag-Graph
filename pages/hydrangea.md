> _Hydrangea_, common names _hydrangea_ or _hortensia_, is a genus of 70–75 species of flowering plants native to Asia and the Americas. By far the greatest species diversity is in eastern Asia, notably China, Korea, and Japan. Most are shrubs 1 to 3 meters tall, but some are small trees, and others lianas reaching up to 30 m (98 ft) by climbing up trees. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrangea))

Common meanings in floriography ([Flower Meaning](https://www.flowermeaning.com/hydrangea-flower-meaning/)):
* heartfelt and honest emotions of any kind;
* gratitude and thanksgiving to someone else;
* developing a deeper understanding between two people;
* heartlessness and acting without thinking about the feelings of another;
* frigidity and disinterest in a romantic proposal;
* boasting and bragging about false accomplishments;
* abundance and prosperity;
* grace and beauty, sometimes taken to an extreme of vanity and narcissism; pride ([hanakotoba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanakotoba));
* the 4th wedding anniversary for a couple.
