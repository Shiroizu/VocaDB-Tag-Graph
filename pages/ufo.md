From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidentified_flying_object):
>An unidentified flying object (UFO) is any aerial phenomenon that cannot immediately be identified or explained. Most UFOs are identified on investigation as conventional objects or phenomena. The term is widely used for claimed observations of extraterrestrial spacecraft.
