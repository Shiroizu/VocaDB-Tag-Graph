#Composition

From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)):
>In music theory, the key of a piece is the group of pitches, or scale, that forms the basis of a musical composition in classical, Western art, and Western pop music.

A song's key can be changed by remixing it into a new one, or using a tool to pitch shift the instruments. 

A key can be changed to make a song easier to sing for different vocal types, or to change the feeling (eg. a change from major to minor).
