#Vocalists

"SAPI", or the Microsoft Speech Application Programming Interface, is the underlying engine behind most of Microsoft's text-to-speech voicebanks. It is a [concatenative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenative_synthesis) speech synthesis engine designed for use within [Windows](https://vocadb.net/T/457) operating systems and other Microsoft programs. It has undergone 5 major generations, with its 4.0 version having been released back on [September 23rd, 1998](https://web.archive.org/web/19981205182433/http://www.research.microsoft.com/srg/).

"Whistler", or "Windows Highly Intelligent STochastic taLkER", is a SAPI 4.0 vocal synthesis engine. Its speech synthesis version was released to public, while its singing synthesis version -- consisting of the vocals Melanie and Mark -- only exists to the public through a few demos.
