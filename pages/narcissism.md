From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissism):
> Narcissism is a self-centered personality style characterized as having an excessive preoccupation with oneself and one's own needs, often at the expense of others. Narcissism exists on a continuum that ranges from normal to abnormal personality expression.
While there exists normal, healthy levels of narcissism in humans, there are also more extreme levels of narcissism, being seen particularly in people who are self-absorbed, or people who have a pathological mental illness like narcissistic personality disorder.
> It is one of the traits featured in the dark triad, along with Machiavellianism and subclinical psychopathy.
