#Derivative

Riza Sotone or by full name, Rizalina Sotone, is a Fanmade Vocaloid by [Orochi Herman](https://vocadb.net/Ar/133662). She was designed to be Filipino-Japanese, and to appeal to a then-minor demography of Filipino vocaloid fans, which has been since steadily growing.

Riza was conceptualized in the earlier part of 2008, as a hypothetical Vocaloid that could sing in any language, limited by the "producer"'s potential. Her creation predates Luka and Ruko by just months. Earlier Vocaloid works that attempted to use voicebanks like Miku for another language, but with lackluster results, became part of the inspiration to create Riza, and the POLYGLOID project.
