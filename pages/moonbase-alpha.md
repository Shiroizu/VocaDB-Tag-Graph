*Moonbase Alpha* is a somewhat-realistic lunar-base management simulator released by NASA. It is best known for coming equipped with a [distinctive version](https://vocadb.net/Ar/85226) of [Fonix DECtalk](https://vocadb.net/T/7890/dectalk), something players have enjoyed abusing to their hearts' content.
