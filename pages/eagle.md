- Eagle: A large bird of prey with a massive hooked bill and long broad wings, known for its keen sight and powerful soaring flight.
- Hawk: A diurnal bird of prey with broad rounded wings and a long tail, typically taking prey by surprise with a short chase.
- Buzzard: A large hawklike bird of prey with broad wings and a rounded tail, often seen soaring in wide circles.
- Kite: A medium to large long-winged bird of prey which typically has a forked tail and frequently soars on updraughts of air.
