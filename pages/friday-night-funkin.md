#Copyrights

> _Friday Night Funkin'_ (often abbreviated to _FNF_) is an open-source donationware rhythm game. Developed by a team of four Newgrounds users; Cameron "ninjamuffin99" Taylor, David "PhantomArcade" Brown, Isaac "kawaisprite" Garcia, and evilsk8r. The game shares some gameplay features with _Dance Dance Revolution_ and _PaRappa the Rapper_, though borrows aesthetic influences from Flash games.
