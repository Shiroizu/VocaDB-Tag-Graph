#Sources

>In music, a medley is a piece composed from parts of existing pieces, usually three, played one after another, sometimes overlapping.
*---from Wikipedia.*

Try to focus on quality when adding medleys: adding too many medleys on VocaDB is not recommended, you should stick to those that are remarkable in some way.

Album crossfades are generally not medleys, unless the songs are played in full.
