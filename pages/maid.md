>A **maid**, or **housemaid** or **maidservant**, is a female **domestic worker**.
In the Victorian era domestic service was the second largest category of employment in England and Wales, after agricultural work.
In developed Western nations, full-time **maids** are now only found in the wealthiest households.
In other parts of the world, **maids** remain common in urban middle-class households.
**"Maid"** in Middle English meant an unmarried woman, especially a young one, or specifically a virgin.
These meanings lived on in English until recent times (and are still familiar from literature and folk music), alongside the sense of the word as a type of **servant**.
