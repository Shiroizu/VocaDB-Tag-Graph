Yandere Simulator is an upcoming stealth action video game in development by American game developer YandereDev. The game centers upon an obsessively lovesick schoolgirl named Ayano Aishi, nicknamed and known mainly as "Yandere-chan", after the Japanese term "yandere", who has taken it upon herself to eliminate anyone she believes is monopolizing her senpai's attention.
