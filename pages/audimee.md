#Vocalists

Audimee is a singing synthesizer program that offers royalty-free vocal synthesizers for projects such as copyright-free music and more. Most of the voicebanks are free, though some require a membership to use. The voicebanks are noted to work on an RVC model. It also offers manual pitch tuning and editing.
