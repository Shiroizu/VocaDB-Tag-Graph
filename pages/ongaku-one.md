#Derivative

Ongaku One is the VOYAKILOID derivative of UTAU [Utane Uta (Defoko)](https://vocadb.net/Ar/803). She was created by PSiCO in July 2023.
One, formerly called Yuki, is a former Voyakiloid project for Defoko. It represents vocal instability and unusual patterns - or even songs that are non-standard.
His surname, Ongaku, comes from the union of the kanji 音 (on), which means "sound" and 楽 (gaku), which means "comfort", "relaxation", "fun" and "music". Together, they form the word for "music," which encompasses a wide range of musical styles and genres. It does not necessarily have a letter, as in the case of the word Uta (歌). One is a play on the pronunciation of the kanji 音, which can be read as both "on" and "ne".
