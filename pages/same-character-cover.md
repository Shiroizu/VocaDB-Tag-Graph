#Sources

This tag is for any cover that utilizes the same general "character" as the original song (but not necessarily the same voicebank). For example, if a base song utilized [Miku NT Original+](https://vocadb.net/Ar/84429) and the cover of it instead used [Miku v4 Dark](https://vocadb.net/Ar/50233), the latter would qualify for this tag.
