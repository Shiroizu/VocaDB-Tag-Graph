#Genres

Hardbass or hard bass (Russian: хардбасс, tr. hardbass, IPA: [xɐrdˈbas]) is a subgenre of electronic music which originated from Russia during the late 1990s, drawing inspiration from UK hard house, bouncy techno, Scouse House, and hardstyle. Hardbass is characterized by its fast tempo (usually 150–175 BPM), donks, distinctive basslines (commonly known as "hard bounce"), distorted sounds, heavy kicks and recently occasional rapping. Hardbass has been widely popular in the countries of the Central and Eastern Europe, and is commonly associated with Slavic and Russian culture after the premiere of the video "Cheeki Breeki Hardbass Anthem" in 2015.
