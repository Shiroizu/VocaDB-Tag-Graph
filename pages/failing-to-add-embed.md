#Editor_notes

Use this when failing to add embedded media that is supposed to be supported by VocaDB. When that occurs, leave the media as an external link and apply this tag.

Use this also when you find an embedded media that is supposed to be publicly playable, but somehow broke down temporarily on VocaDB.

Encounting such situations suggests issues with the streaming service and/or with VocaDB, and they would be looked after by the editing and maintaining community.
