#Themes

"All your base are belong to us" is a popular Internet meme based on a phrase found in the opening cutscene of the European release of the 1992 Mega Drive/Genesis port of the 1989 arcade video game Zero Wing, which is subtitled and poorly translated.

The phrase or some variation of lines from the game has appeared in numerous articles, books, comics, clothing, movies, radio shows, songs, television shows, video games, webcomics, and websites.
