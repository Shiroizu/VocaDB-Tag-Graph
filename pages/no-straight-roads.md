#Copyrights

>No Straight Roads is a 2020 action-adventure game developed by Malaysian independent studio Metronomik, and published by Sold Out Ltd. The focus is on an indie rock duo who battle an EDM empire to free Vinyl City from their control with the power of rock. The game combat involves listening to the music, knowing when enemies attack and when to strike.
