#Genres

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrash_metal):
>Thrash metal (or simply thrash) is a subgenre of heavy metal music characterized by its overall aggression and often fast tempo. The songs usually use fast percussive beats and low-register guitar riffs, overlaid with shredding-style lead work. The lyrics often deal with social issues and reproach of The Establishment, using direct and denunciatory language, an approach borrowed from hardcore punk.
