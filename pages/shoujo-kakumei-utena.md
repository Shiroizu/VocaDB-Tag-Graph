> Revolutionary Girl Utena is a Japanese anime television series created by Be-Papas, a production group formed by director Kunihiko Ikuhara composed of himself, Chiho Saito, Shinya Hasegawa, Yōji Enokido, and Yūichirō Oguro.
The series was produced by J.C.Staff, and originally aired on TV Tokyo from April to December 1997.
Revolutionary Girl Utena follows Utena Tenjou, a teenaged girl drawn into a sword dueling tournament to win the hand of Anthy Himemiya, a mysterious girl known as the "Rose Bride" who possesses the "power to revolutionize the world".
(...)
Shinkichi Mitsumune composed the score for Utena, while the songs in the series are Mitsumune's rearrangements of songs by composer [J. A. Seazer](https://vocadb.net/Ar/75443).
