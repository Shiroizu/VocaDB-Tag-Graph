#Genres

A "sea shanty" is a folk song style developed aboard ships, often with a lyrical focus on the life of a sailor. Many of them are [work songs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_song), using a prevalent, downbeat-heavy rhythm to help the flow of labour. However, other styles of shanties exist, from rowdy drinking songs to bardic story songs to anything in-between.
