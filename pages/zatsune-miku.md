#Derivative

Zatsune Miku is a fan-made derivative of [Hatsune Miku](http://vocadb.net/Ar/1), created by [aloha](https://vocadb.net/Ar/80595). She's often portrayed as an "evil" Miku. Use this tag for songs or albums that explicitly define the use of this derivative.

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
