#Vocalists

A free text-to-speech synthesizer program developed by [bisu](https://vocadb.net/Ar/113066) that was released in December 2021. Unlike most speech synthesis programs, UniCoe actually has no native banks of its own: instead, users import voicebanks from other engines, including singing synths without innate speech capability. Natively, the program supports imports from UTAU; with plugins, one can make UniCoe compatible with other synthesizers.

[Tsukuyomi-chan's UTAU voicebank](https://vocadb.net/Ar/91762) is the [default voice](https://vocadb.net/T/9358/default-voice) for the program.
