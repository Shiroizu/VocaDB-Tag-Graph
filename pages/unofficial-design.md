#Animation

For alternative designs/outfits (tag entries) that artists/fans invented for existing voice synth characters.
*Note that fanloids are considered derivatives, since they usually have a voice configuration.*

This tag is especially useful for fan-designs of voice synths that do not have an official design or official human character as a design.
