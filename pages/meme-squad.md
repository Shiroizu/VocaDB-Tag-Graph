#Vocalists

The "Meme Squad" refers to the specific grouping of Flower, Fukase, Oliver, and Utatane Piko together, often in comedic fashion. Occasionally, this group may feature Kagamine Rin or Len.

The term and grouping is popular with western producers and Vocaloid fans, especially in the United States. The origin of the group name cannot be traced, but it is commonly used in the west.
