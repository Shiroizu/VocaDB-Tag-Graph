#Derivative

**Frimotan** (フリモたん) also known as **Frimo** (フリモ) is a derivative of [Frimomen](https://vocadb.net/Ar/110785), whose description is: "a very cute magical girl who is known to be a strong ally of Flash craftsmen. There is not a person inside her."

An official member of the *frimo* software series, Frimotan is often used in jokes, wherein she is presented as an absurd alternative costume Frimomen wears. Files of her speech are included in Frimomen's [pitagoe](https://vocadb.net/T/9201). As of [Frimomen's Synthesizer V release](https://vocadb.net/Ar/131564), cover artists have tried to imitate her configuration in songs.
