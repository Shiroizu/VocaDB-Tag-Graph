> Vomiting is the involuntary, forceful expulsion of the contents of one's stomach through the mouth and sometimes the nose.
Vomiting can be the result of ailments like food poisoning, gastroenteritis, pregnancy, motion sickness, or hangover; or it can be an after effect of diseases such as brain tumors, elevated intracranial pressure, or overexposure to ionizing radiation.
The feeling that one is about to vomit is called nausea; it often precedes, but does not always lead to vomiting.
Impairment due to alcohol or anesthesia can cause inhalation of vomit, leading to suffocation.
In severe cases, where dehydration develops, intravenous fluid may be required.
Antiemetics are sometimes necessary to suppress nausea and vomiting.
Self-induced vomiting can be a component of an eating disorder such as bulimia, and is itself now classified as an eating disorder on its own, purging disorder.
