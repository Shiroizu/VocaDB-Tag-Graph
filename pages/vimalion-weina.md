#Animation

Design for the Synthesizer V [Weina](https://vocadb.net/Ar/76161) created by the group [VIMALION PROJECT](https://vocadb.net/Ar/110180).

Illustration by [rice](https://vocadb.net/Ar/69939) from the [VIMALION website](https://vimalion.pro/).

> The first member of the "SynthV AI Gold" series. An enigmatic woman that radiates elegance and maturity- though at time she comes off as a bit detached.
