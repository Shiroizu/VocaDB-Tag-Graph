Beastars is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Paru Itagaki. It was serialized in Akita Shoten's Weekly Sh≈çnen Champion from September 2016 to October 2020. The story takes place in a modern world of civilized, anthropomorphic animals with a cultural divide between carnivores and herbivores, and where eating meat (which always comes from other anthropomorphic animals) is strictly illegal.
