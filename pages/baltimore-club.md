#Genres

>Baltimore Club is a music genre that fuses breakbeat and house. It was created in Baltimore, Maryland in the early to late 1990s by 2 Live Crew's Luther Campbell, Frank Ski, and DJ K-Swift, among others.
Baltimore club is based on an 8/4 beat structure, and includes tempos around 130 beats per minute. It combines repetitive, looped vocal snippets similar to trap, bounce, ghetto house and ghettotech and is a sample-based form of breakbeat. Samples used include theme songs from shows like Sanford and Son, SpongeBob SquarePants and Elmo's World. The instrumental tracks include heavy breakbeats and call and response stanzas similar to those found in the go-go music of Washington, D.C. The most prominent breakbeats sampled include "Sing Sing" by disco band "Gaz" and "Think (About It)" by Lyn Collins. (from Wikipedia)
