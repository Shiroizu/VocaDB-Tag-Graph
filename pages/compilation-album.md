#Sources

Collection of songs from multiple sources, either new or old. 

Compilation albums fall under two main categories:

* "Greatest hits" albums, with previously released songs gathered from one or more earlier albums. 
* Collaboration albums or tribute albums, with mainly new, unreleased songs by multiple artists.

#### Tag usage

This tag can be applied as secondary type to albums, when the album type is something other than "Compilation". If album type is already "Compilation", this tag is redundant.
