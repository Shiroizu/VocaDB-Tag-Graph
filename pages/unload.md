#Animation

A joke design of the [default](https://vocadb.net/Ar/114520) [Synthesizer V](https://vocadb.net/T/6745/synthesizer-v) voicebank when no other voice is selected for a track. It's name, "UNLOAD", comes from it's listing as "(unload)" in the database selection list, as well as meaning "not loaded" in reference to a voicebank not being loaded in.

They were first conceived by [oh look it's james](https://vocadb.net/Ar/110172), and designed by [UpTown-P](https://vocadb.net/Ar/85018) (art shown), inspired by [ivylare's](https://vocadb.net/Ar/75116) designs of [Dreamtonics](https://vocadb.net/Ar/76460) vocals in stickman-like forms.
