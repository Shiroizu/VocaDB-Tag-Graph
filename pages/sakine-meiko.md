#Derivative

Sakine Meiko was created to be a young [MEIKO](https://vocadb.net/Ar/176).

Sakine Meiko (咲音メイコ) is an officially recognized derivative. The term "Derivative" is used here to describe a fanmade Vocaloid character that is based on an already existing character.

She was conceived through the efforts of Producers working with MEIKO's voice, When many producers wondered if MEIKO was an older-sounding vocal, or younger-sounding vocal. (They quickly set on KAITO's voice since he sounded older.) Because of this, MEIKO had become forgotten because of Hatsune Miku's popularity, leaving her behind. MEIKO in particular did not have the younger sounding voice of the released VOCALOID2 voicebanks released at the time and therefore was not as appealing as they were to the Vocaloid Otaku based fandom.
