#Genres

"Progressive music" is a curious genre: it is, in fact, marked by the presence of *multiple* genres within a work. A progressive song is divided into multiple sections, often each with their own identifiable genre or genre-area that they work within. Occasionally, prog music will stick within one predominant genre, and instead focus down on changing its rhythms, melody lines, and tempo. This overall 'genre' tends long, windy, and [avant-garde](https://vocadb.net/T/28/avant-garde). 

The most popular progressive genre is, by far and away, [prog rock](https://vocadb.net/T/1655/progressive-rock). Indeed, we have many tags for various genre-specific progressive pieces, so please use those instead when applicable.
