#Themes

Songs that revolve around or talk about nihilism. Simply put, nihilism is the act of disregarding all moral and religious beliefs in the notion that life is meaningless in the end. Nihilism often sprouts from trauma or mental illness.

Can also apply to albums with songs about nihilism, or artists who produce songs about nihilism.
