#Genres

Ballroom, or ballroom beats, refers to the various kinds of dance music derived from classic House tracks played at what is known as the ballroom scene. Ballroom beats are syncopated, hard-hitting, clipped, loud and highly prominent in the mix, with melody being less important. The genre is given a unified sound by widespread use of samples from the Masters at Work track "The Ha Dance". The crash sample known as "the Ha" or the "Ha crash", is a key component of many ballroom tracks, and the hoover sound that can be heard in "The Ha Dance" has been traced back to the Dr. Baker track Kaos. One major progenitor of the ballroom sound is Vjuan Allure, whilst other notable producers include MikeQ and DJ Angel X. Some producers incorporate elements from genres like Baltimore Club. Vocals are often provided by MCs known as commentators.

Ballroom culture has been a part of underground gay and transgender America since the 1800s, with the subculture being first brought to mainstream attention with the 1990 film Paris Is Burning. At balls, drag and non-drag participants perform and compete before a panel of judges, often with a heavily stylized form of dancing based around modelling poses known as voguing. The music played at balls, as shown in the film, comprised of Disco and house. Artists like Kevin Aviance and Junior Vasquez would make ballroom-oriented house music during the early 1990s, but it was only later that the distinct sound of the ballroom beat would emerge.

There are different types of Ballroom beats for the different categories of the ball. For instance, "The Ha Dance" with its 128bpm tempo and bouncy, syncopated rhythm is the seminal anthem for the sub-style of voguing known as vogue fem especially in beginner categories, but vogue fem beats for more experienced performers can be noisier and faster, reaching tempos up to 135bpm. In contrast, new way voguing doesn't involve dips on the 8th beat, so new way beats tend to omit the Ha, instead focusing on a more continuous sound with open hats on the offbeat. The most rhythmically complicated beats are reserved for hands performance and arms control categories, the classic example being the Kevin Aviance track "Din Da Da". Runway beats on the other hand have a throbbing pulse, such as that in the Robbie Tronco track "Runway (As A House)".

While continuing to thrive in its scene, the influence and ideas of ballroom have spread into the broader lexicon of underground club music while also appearing within a more mainstream context amongst various genres, most notably in releases such as Broke With Expensive Taste and Renaissance.
