#Themes

A Japanese transliteration of the English slang word gal, a Japanese fashion subculture.

>It is a fashion subculture that is considered to be nonconformist or rebelling against the Japanese standards of its society and beauty at the time when women were expected to be housewives and fit Asian beauty standards of pale skin and dark hair. 
>For Japanese women who saw those who participated in this fashion during its rise, they considered it a fashion style too racy and freewheeling; with some feeling it caused a ruckus, juvenile delinquency and frivolousness among teenage women.
>Its popularity peaked in the 1990s and early 2000s. 
>They are also known for partying or clubbing, being rather provocative, being flirtatious and unwinding and having fun.

Typically characterized by:
- tanned skin
- heavily bleached or dyed hair (mostly brown or blonde)
- highly decorated nails
- dramatic, eye-enlarging makeup (dark eyeliner, fake eyelashes, contouring)
- being extroverted and open
- going partying/clubbing
