#Genres

Proto-punk (or protopunk) is the rock music played by garage bands from the 1960s to mid-1970s that presaged the punk rock movement. The phrase is a retrospective label; the musicians involved were generally not originally associated with each other, and came from a variety of backgrounds and styles, but together they anticipated many of punk's musical and thematic attributes.
*-Wikipedia*

Proto-punk is a fairly vague term used to describe music that either influenced or resembled Punk Rock before the commercial breakthrough of punk in 1976. Common characteristics include provocative attitude, use of noise or abrasiveness, wild, untamed energy and stripped-down simplicity.

Sometimes the line between proto-punk and punk rock is blurred â€“ even artists who belonged to the CBGB punk scene of the early-to-mid 1970s have been labelled proto-punk simply because they predate the commercial breakthrough of Sex Pistols.

Retrospective term to describe music that influenced what would be coined as punk rock. It tended to be somewhat more aggressive than its contemporaries and often had anti-authoritarian themes.Such music included, The Velvet Underground, The Stooges, bands on the Nuggets compilation, The Sonics, The Seeds, The Monks, Patti Smith, The Dictators, New York Dolls, MC5, Richard Hell & the Voidoids, Neu!, etc. Not all influences of punk rock bands can be called protopunk. For example, Crass was influenced by experimentalist compser, John Cage, but nobody would call him a protopunk artist.
