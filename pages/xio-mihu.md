#Animation

Xiao Meihua is one of the two mascots for the [Miyo DiffSinger](https://vocadb.net/Ar/136863) voicebank, alongside [Miyo](https://vocadb.net/T/11430). The voicebank (and any subsequent AI-type voicebanks) was originally created solely for Miyo, but was later decided to have Meihua serve as an optional representative character for users who prefer her.

This tag is to be used for artwork, such as in PVs or illustrations, featuring Xiao Meihua for AI-type voicebanks.
