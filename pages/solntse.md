#Derivative

For albums and songs that explicitly define the usage of the derivative, Solntse. He's the genderbent version of [Solaria](https://vocadb.net/Ar/76317), and is made using her voicebank.

Art by [tiramika](https://vocadb.net/Ar/91421).

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
