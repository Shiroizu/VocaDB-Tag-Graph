#Animation

> Brazilian Miku refers to a series of fan art, animations and memes that imagine vocaloid character Hatsune Miku as Brazilian. The artworks depict Miku as a young tanned Brazilian woman wearing a yellow crop top with the flag of Brazil on it and short denim shorts with thong straps sticking out and with tan lines visible on her legs and shoulders. Spawned by a sketch by artist [ErinArtista](https://x.com/erinartista?lang=en), the fan art trend went viral onTwitter in August 2024.
