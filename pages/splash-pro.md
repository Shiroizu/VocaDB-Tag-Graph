#Vocalists

Developed by Splash, Splash Pro was a free plugin for various programs, such as [GarageBand](https://vocadb.net/T/7763/garageband), [FL Studio](https://vocadb.net/T/3257/fl-studio), Logic, [Ableton](https://vocadb.net/T/6571/ableton-live), and Pro Tools. It was released on [December 6th, 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20210227114752/https://musically.com/2019/12/06/end-game-ai-music-popgun/), having already been out in a beta format for [a few months prior](https://twitter.com/SplashMusicCo/status/1166342846909050880). Notably for us, the program came equipped with two AI voicebanks of its own: [one male](https://vocadb.net/Ar/116030) and [one female](https://vocadb.net/Ar/80081).
As of [April 26th, 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/VSTi/comments/ucwhxa/splash_pro/), the program can no longer be accessed in any way.
