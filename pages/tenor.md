#Vocalists

The highest **male** voice typically between C3 and C5.

___

>A **tenor** is a type of classical **male** singing voice whose vocal range lies between the **countertenor** and **baritone** voice types.
It is the highest **male** chest voice type.
The **tenor's** vocal range extends up to C5.
The low extreme for **tenors** is widely defined to be B2, though some roles include an A♭2 (two A♭s below middle C).
At the highest extreme, some **tenors** can sing up to the second F above middle C (F5).
The **tenor** voice type is generally divided into the leggero tenor, lyric tenor, spinto tenor, dramatic tenor, heldentenor, and tenor buffo or spieltenor.

>A **countertenor** (also contra tenor) is a type of classical **male** singing voice whose vocal range is equivalent to that of the **female contralto** or **mezzo-soprano** voice types, generally extending from around G3 to D5 or E5, although a **sopranist** (a specific kind of **countertenor**) may match the **soprano's** range of around C4 to C6.
**Countertenors** often have **tenor** or **baritone** chest voices, but sing in falsetto or head voice much more often than they do in their chest voice.
