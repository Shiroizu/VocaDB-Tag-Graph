#Instruments

The trumpet is a brass instrument with cylindrical tubing and front-facing bell. It is the highest-pitched member of the brass section and has the characteristic powerful sound. It's a regular member of orchestras and concert bands
Most of modern trumpets are pitched in B♭ and plays a major second lower than their written part. However, in American orchestral setting, the C trumpet (smaller and plays just as written) is more common.

The trumpet has a close relative, the cornet. The later has more conical tubing, mellower sound, and more compact design.
