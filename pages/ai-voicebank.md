#Vocalists

AI voicebanks are designed to be compatible with engines using neural network technology. 
There are three general styles:

* standard voicebanks with automated tuning ([CeVIO AI](https://vocadb.net/T/7717/cevio-ai), [Synth-V AI](https://vocadb.net/T/7707/synthesizer-v-ai), [ENUNU](https://vocadb.net/T/7693/nnsvs), etc.)
* [voice conversion](https://vocadb.net/T/9281/voice-conversion) ([Voidol](https://vocadb.net/T/7689/voidol), [Seiren Voice](https://vocadb.net/T/8889/seiren-voice), [Diff-SVC](https://vocadb.net/T/9282/diff-svc), etc.)
* generative vocals ([Koemotion](https://vocadb.net/T/9695/koemotion))

Please do not confuse this with the ["artificial intelligence"](https://vocadb.net/T/7171/artificial-intelligence) tag: that tag is specifically for entries themed around AI and artificial intelligence, while this one is for a real life technological advancement within the vocal synth field. While they may overlap, the differences between the two tags are important.
