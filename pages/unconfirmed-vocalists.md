#Editor_notes

This tag applies when the vocalists (usually Vocaloid/UTAU) are based on hearing or other assumption without hard confirmation. This also applies when the voicebank version (such as Vocaloid3/V4/V5) is assumed.

Always try to find out the real vocalists instead of relying on the assumption, but sometimes that's not possible. It is ok to mark the entry as finalized (but not approved) even when the vocalists are not confirmed. Mentioning details in edit notes, comments or description field is also recommended.

Remove this tag if the voicebank used gets confirmed.
