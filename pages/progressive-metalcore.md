#Genres

>*--Progressive metalcore (also called technical metalcore or ambient metalcore) is a fusion of progressive metal and metalcore characterized by highly technical lead guitar, "atmospheric" elements, and complex instrumentation. Some notable practitioners take influence from djent.

>*--from Wikipedia*

Wikipedia considers "progressive metalcore" and "technical metalcore" synonyms, but a small distinction can be made. Progressive metalcore challenges typical song conventions. Technical metalcore challenges players with its instrumental difficulty.

**Progressive metalcore** is a metalcore subgenre that has a combination of longer song formats, various unusual time signatures, more instruments than only guitars/bass/drums (thus "complex instrumentation"), extremely varying vocal ranges, and more complex conceptual ideas (especially lyrics) as well as the metalcore elements.

Included amongst the links is *Secular Eden* by ANLMA as example of progressive metalcore.
