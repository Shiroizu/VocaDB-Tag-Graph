#Themes

Doppelgangers are people who look alike, despite not being related. Within mythology and fiction, doppelgangers are often at odds, working as antagonists to the other. Their existence may also be due to supernatural occurrences, such as literally being mirrored doubles. 

This tag may also overlap with the [multiple persona](https://vocadb.net/T/6753/multiple-persona) tag, as seen in [時富まいむ's](https://vocadb.net/Ar/15943) artwork. It depicts two [KAFUs](https://vocadb.net/Ar/83928) in conflict with one another.
