#Themes

Hakata no Shio (伯方の塩) is a Japanese salt brand known for its long-running commercial jingle. It became a popular source for [MAD videos](https://vocadb.net/T/1701) in 2008.

Users on NicoNicoPedia invented the fanmade mascot Hakata-san (伯方さん), a poncho-wearing character whose gender is up to interpretation. The character's theme song, written by [LamazeP](https://vocadb.net/Ar/304), became a meme in early 2009.
