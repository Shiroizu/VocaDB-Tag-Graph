#Derivative

(Note: Due to the fact that Ruko already has a male voicebank, having a genderswapped Yokune Ruko would be considered redundant. However, this is just for fun and is not intended to contradict Yokune Ruko's gender in any way.)

**Yokune Ruto** (欲音ルト) also known as **Yokune Rukoto** (欲音ルコト) is a genderswapped derivative of the UTAU [Yokune](https://vocadb.net/Ar/34013) [Ruko](https://vocadb.net/Ar/2673), created by mugimeshi. The creation of the concept was previously started by YouTube user Utauloid Duets in 2018. The project is being continued by Benzarro85/VocaloidKAITO1234 in 2024.

In 2018, Yokune Ruto was created under the name Yokune Rukoto by the YouTube channel Utauloid Duets, featuring Ievan Polkka covers using Ruko's female and male voice banks. It was created as an interpretation of what Ruko's gender-swapping derivative would look like if Ruko had not been identified as having two genders.

These videos reached about 1.6 thousand views on YouTube. However, despite the popularity of the videos, he is little known by the UTAU community.

In 2024, Benzarro85 coined the idea of Yokune Rukoto and decided to expand its existence. Benzarro85 changed his name from Rukoto to Ruto, as he felt it was a better match for Ruto.

Extra Information:

* Gender: Bigender/Intersex (90% female, 10% male)
* Age: 12
