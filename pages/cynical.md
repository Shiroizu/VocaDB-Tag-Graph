#Subjective

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynicism_(contemporary)):
> Cynicism is an attitude characterized by a general distrust of the motives of others. A cynic may have a general lack of faith or hope in people motivated by ambition, desire, greed, gratification, materialism, goals, and opinions that a cynic perceives as vain, unobtainable, or ultimately meaningless.

Songs where the main character is cynical, or a victim of cynicism. Can also apply to songs or albums that are about or related to cynicism.

Only apply to albums or artists if most of their songs are about or hint towards cynicism. (Not to be confused with the Bullying tag)
