#Genres

>Nu metal (sometimes stylized as nü-metal) is a subgenre of alternative metal that combines elements of heavy metal music with elements of other music genres such as hip hop, alternative rock, funk, industrial, and grunge.
> *--from Wikipedia*

Nu metal relies more on power chords and heavily downtuned guitars (usually 6-string and 7-string guitars that are down-tuned) to create a heavier sound. Some bands also include a DJ on turntables as part of their lineup to further emphasize these elements, such as sampling and turntable scratching. Vocal styles include rapping, singing, or screaming, often resembling those found in hardcore punk or extreme metal.
