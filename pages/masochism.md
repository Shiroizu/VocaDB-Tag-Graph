#Themes

Songs about masochism, the opposite of sadism. This tag can be used for songs where the character(s) is a masochist and enjoys getting hurt by others (typically in a sexual context), or songs where the character(s) harm themselves and find joy or comfort in doing so.

This tag may also be used for songs where the character doesn't particularly enjoy pain, but due to abuse and/or depression, has become addicted to it, and/or embraces the pain as a normal part of their life.

The artwork comes from the song by Guity, titled MASOCHIST.
