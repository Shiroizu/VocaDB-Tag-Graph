#Derivative

For songs or albums that explicitly define the use of the derivative, Starsand (星砂).

Starsand is a derived voice configuration (genderswap) for the VOCALOID [Stardust (星尘)](https://vocadb.net/Ar/35966) in which the original voicebank's tone is adjusted significantly.
___
Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
