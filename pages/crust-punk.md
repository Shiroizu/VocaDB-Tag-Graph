#Genres

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crust_punk#Characteristics):

>Crust punk is a derivative form of hardcore punk and anarcho-punk, mixed with metal riffs. The tempos are often fast, but just short of thrashcore or grindcore. However, many groups confine themselves to a crawling, sludgy pace. The overall musical sound has been described as being "stripped down". Drumming is typically done at high speed, with D-beats sometimes being used.
