#Vocalists

VOICEPEAK is an AI text-input reading software by [AHS](https://vocadb.net/Ar/192) in collaboration with [Dreamtonics](https://vocadb.net/Ar/76460). The software supports emotion-based speech via [Dreamtonics](https://vocadb.net/Ar/76460)' AI speech synthesis Syllaflow technology. The engine itself is available when you buy either the narrator sets or the character vocals; it does not come on its own. VOICEPEAK is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.

The "6 Narrator Set" contains [three](https://vocadb.net/Ar/113205) [masculine](https://vocadb.net/Ar/113206) [voices](https://vocadb.net/Ar/113207) and [three](https://vocadb.net/Ar/113204) [feminine](https://vocadb.net/Ar/113208) [voices](https://vocadb.net/Ar/113203), plus one voice replicating that of an [elementary girl](https://vocadb.net/Ar/113209) (as voiced by [Tateishi Mito](https://vocadb.net/Ar/114419)). By getting the first set, the second Narrator set, which consists of [Boy](https://vocadb.net/Ar/114405), [Male 4](https://vocadb.net/Ar/114404), and [Female 4](https://vocadb.net/Ar/114403), is offered discounted. Both sets come with the standard four vocal modes: happy, fun, angry, and sad. 

All character vocals come bundled with [Frimomen](https://vocadb.net/Ar/110785) except for [Jashin-chan](https://vocadb.net/Ar/117028) and [Otomachi Una](https://vocadb.net/Ar/123479); Frimomen can also be purchased on his own. [Zundamon](https://vocadb.net/Ar/114402) may only be accessed by purchasing either [Touhoku Zunko](https://vocadb.net/Ar/114401), [Itako](https://vocadb.net/Ar/124906), or [Kiritan](https://vocadb.net/Ar/119787). [Poron-chan](https://vocadb.net/Ar/122749) may only be accessed by purchasing [Haruno Sora](https://vocadb.net/Ar/122747).
