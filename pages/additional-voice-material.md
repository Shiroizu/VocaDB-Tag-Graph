#Vocalists

Sound packs contain a variety of sound files often not covered by an actual voice bank. This includes sighs, laughs, or even short, in-character phrases.

This tag is specifically for generic, unnamed, or unique sound packs.
It can be used on:

* voicebanks that come with an attached sound/sample pack
* songs that utilize generic sound/sample packs
* albums that contain the aforementioned songs
