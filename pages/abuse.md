From Wikipedia:
> Abuse is the improper usage or treatment of an entity, often to unfairly or improperly gain benefit. Abuse can come in many forms, such as: physical or verbal maltreatment, injury, assault, violation, rape, unjust practices, crimes, or other types of aggression.

> Violence is often defined as the use of physical force or power by humans to cause harm and degradation to other living beings, such as humiliation, pain, injury, disablement, damage to property and ultimately death, as well as destruction to a society's living environment.

This tag typically applies to songs where a character is being mentally or physically abused or hurt. This tag covers multiple types of abuse and violence in relationships (domestic, parental, sexual, emotional, physical, religious, etc.)
