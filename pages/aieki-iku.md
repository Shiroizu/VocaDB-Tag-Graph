#Derivative

Aieki Iku is a derivative of Acme Iku and who's voice is based off of CUL or v flower.

Illustrated by	Kyaramel
Character designer	Kyaramel

Iku was created as a joke fanloid by her creator Zansatsu with her original name being "Hentaine, Ecchi" although later on through concept and creation, her name was changed to Aieki Iku. Aieki meaning "sexual fluids/genital secretions" and Iku meaning "to have an orgasm". Iku is meant to serve as the pure embodiment of perverted and lewd fanloids, which led to her founding of the Hentai Anonymous Association (HAA). -Fanloid wiki
