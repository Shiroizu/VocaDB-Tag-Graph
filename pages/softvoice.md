#Vocalists

A non-standalone vocal synthesis engine intended to be licensed for use in other programs, most notably [FL Studio](https://vocadb.net/T/3257/fl-studio). While not an instrument itself, it can instead be used by either dragging or right-clicking a speech preset. There are 20 vocals within the program, with the most famous being the "Child" bank (better known as the official voice of [FL-chan](https://vocadb.net/Ar/16112)). Each vocal can be set as either Natural, Monotone, Sing, or Random, and then can be furthered adjusted to be either Normal, Breathy, or Whispered.
