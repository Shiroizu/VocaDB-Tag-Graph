#Vocalists

To be used when the song or album is using a distinct voice synthesizer voicebank (usually an UTAU), but the voicebank doesn't (yet) have a name.

This is different from [unspecified voicebank](http://vocadb.net/T/2982/unspecified-voicebank), where the voicebank used simply isn't specified in any way.
