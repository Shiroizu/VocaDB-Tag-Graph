#Derivative

CUO or CULKI is the genderswap based on the official Vocaloid [CUL](https://vocadb.net/Ar/381). Art is by sushi-rabu.

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
