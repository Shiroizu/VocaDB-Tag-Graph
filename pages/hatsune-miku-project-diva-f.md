> Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA f (Japanese: 初音ミク -Project DIVA- f) is a 2012 rhythm game created by Sega and Crypton Future Media for the PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3.
It was released on the PlayStation Vita in Japan on August 30, 2012 as the fifth entry in the Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA series.

> The game debuted at Sony's E3 2012 booth in June 2012 under the name of Hatsune Miku so as to gauge interest for the game.
Like previous games in the series, the game primarily makes use of Vocaloids, a series of singing synthesizer software, and the songs created using these Vocaloids, most notably the virtual-diva Hatsune Miku.

> A PlayStation 3 version of the game, titled Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA F (Japanese: 初音ミク -Project DIVA- F) (the only difference being the title uses a capital F is used as opposed to the original Vita version's lowercase f) was released on March 7, 2013.
This version was released physically and digitally in North America on August 27, 2013, making it the first game in the Project DIVA series to be released in the West.
It was originally scheduled to be released in Europe at the same time, but instead released one week later, on September 4, 2013 as a digital download-only title.
The PlayStation Vita version was later released in North America and Europe in March 2014, both as digital download-only titles as well.
This therefore makes it the first game in the series to be multi-platform, with it being developed simultaneously for the PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3, though there are some differences with regards to control schemes.

> A sequel to the game, titled Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA F 2nd, was released for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita on March 27, 2014 in Japan, November 18, 2014 in North America, and November 21, 2014 in Europe.
