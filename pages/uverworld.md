From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uverworld):
>Uverworld (stylized as UVERworld) is a Japanese rock band consisting of six members and originating from Kusatsu, Shiga. "Uverworld" is a term coined by the band members, combining the German word "über" (meaning "over") with the English word "world" to form a phrase that means "crossing above the world".
