#Genres

> _Color bass_ is a subgenre of brostep that evolved in the mid-2010s.
> _Color bass_ can be described as a middle point between the melodic and lush production of melodic dubstep and future bass, and the hard-hitting and upbeat brostep. In simple terms, _color bass_ is contemporary brostep, but with a focus on bright and colourful production.
