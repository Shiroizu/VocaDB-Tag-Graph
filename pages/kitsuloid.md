#Derivative

KiTSULOiD is a V-synth Arctic fox derivative based on [SynthV Yuma](https://vocadb.net/Ar/109074). 

> Known for his orange eyes and extremely curly fur. His passionate personality is shown through in the genre of songs he sings, usually heartfelt, orchestral, or ones of romance.

KiTSULOiD's base voice is [SynthV Yuma AI](https://vocadb.net/Ar/109074). His parameters were changed to be slightly breathy, lower-pitched, and slightly tense for a more passionate and emotional voice. As FennKo wanted to achieve a more androgynous, but slightly deeper voice that matches up for an 18-year-old.
