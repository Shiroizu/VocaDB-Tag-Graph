#Themes

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexuality):
>Asexuality is the **lack of sexual attraction to others**, or low or absent interest in or desire for sexual activity. [...] **Asexuality is distinct from abstention from sexual activity and from celibacy**, which are behavioral and generally motivated by factors such as an individual's personal, social, or religious beliefs. Sexual orientation, unlike sexual behavior, is believed to be "enduring".

This tag applies to:

* Songs thematically related to the asexual spectrum
* Albums thematically related to, or with a surplus of songs about asexuality
* Artists who frequently produce songs with these subjects
* Canonically asexual voicebank characters.
