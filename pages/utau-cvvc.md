#Vocalists

>CVVC uses CV's (Consonant-Vowels) such as "ka" and "ke"; V's and VV's (Vowels and Vowel-Vowels) such as "a" and "ai" ; and VC's (Vowel-Consonants) such as "ak" and "ek". So for example the word arigato would look like:

>"a" "ar" "ri" "ig" "ga" "at" "to"

>This is a very popular method for creating reclists in other languages (besides Japanese). The most popular kind of CVVC is English.
