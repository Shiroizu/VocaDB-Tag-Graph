#Instruments

"Solos" are musical sections where a single instrument takes the lead role. Notably, the solo instrument is usually not the melody instrument prior, making the solo section distinctive and marked. This tag is for songs that feature saxophones in a solo section.

The illustration is by [タコサマ　オマエ　マルカジリ](https://vocadb.net/Ar/66038).
