#Genres

>Breakbeat is characterized by a prominent, syncopated 4/4 rhythm constructed from breakbeats—i.e., sampled drum breakdowns from rock, jazz, funk, and hip-hop music. Unlike jungle, breakbeat has very little variation or rearrangement of the drum patterns, and it is usually slower/mid-tempo, roughly 100 to 125 BPM, speeding up as the style evolved into jungle. Breakbeat also tends to utilize drum breaks sampled from early recordings of funk, jazz, and R&B.
