#Animation

Benzarro85's design for Leona based on Damaru LEON. Any piece of information not talking about her design is Benzarro85's own interpretation of Leona, e.g. personality.
___
**Appearance**:

Leona appears shorter than Lohan, with blonde hair, green eyes and fair skin. Her hair appears longer than Damaru LEON, with a strand of her hair resting on her chest like Megurine Luka. Her outfit is derived from Damaru LEON, except it is altered to appear more feminine. Leona wears a purple, long-sleeved, button-up shirt that is unbuttoned on the higher end to reveal parts of her breasts. She wears dark purple trousers with a black and grey belt, followed by black shoes.
___
**Personality**:

Leona is loud, confident and extroverted. Unlike Lohan, Leona loves to socialise with literally anyone and everyone. She sees herself as being the "friend of the group" while Lohan usually disagrees. While her gestures to Lohan always are platonic, and she is aware of his dismissive responses, Leona wishes no ill-will towards him. Unlike Lohan, she doesn't hang with Leon as much as what Lohan does with Lola.
