#Sources

For songs, music videos and albums that are live music recordings, usually concert recordings or club editions.

- Note that just because the song says "live version" it doesn't automatically mean it was *actually* recorded live. For "fake" live versions, the "[live imitation tag](https://vocadb.net/T/6918/live-imitation)" should be used.
