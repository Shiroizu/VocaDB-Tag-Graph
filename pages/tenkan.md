#Themes

A small white triangular piece of cloth typically displayed on the forehead, called "天冠" (tenkan).
In some parts of Japan, it is also called a "額隠" (hitaikakushi), "頭巾" (zukin), "額烏帽子" (hitai-eboshi) or "髪隠し" (kami-kakushi).

> Traditionally, the tenkan was one component of a traditional burial garment (shini-shouzoku / 死に装束). The garment also typically included a white kimono (...).
