#Themes

A Japanese discourse or media focusing on the attraction to young or prepubescent girls.

The term lolicon is a portmanteau of the phrase "Lolita complex"; it describes an attraction to young or prepubescent girls, an individual with such an attraction, or lolicon manga or lolicon anime, a genre of manga and anime wherein childlike female characters are often depicted in an "erotic-cute" manner (also known as ero kawaii), in an art style reminiscent of the shōjo manga (girls' comics) style.

Use on artist entries is restricted to voicebanks only, and only if it's an official label.
