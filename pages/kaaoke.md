From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaoke):
>Karaoke (/ˌkæriˈoʊki/; Japanese: [kaɾaoke] ; カラオケ, clipped compound of Japanese kara 空 "empty" and ōkesutora オーケストラ "orchestra") is a type of interactive entertainment system usually offered in clubs and bars, where people sing along to pre-recorded accompaniment using a microphone.
>
>Its musical content is an instrumental rendition of a well-known popular song. In recent times, lyrics are typically displayed on a video screen, along with a moving symbol, changing colour, or music video images, to guide the singer.
