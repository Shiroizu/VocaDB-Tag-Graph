The oboe is a double-reed woodwind instrument. It's well-known for its characteristic bright voice and regarded as the most difficult and physically demanding woodwind instrument to play. It's a regular member of orchestra and concert bands.

There's two member of oboe family in common use: the regular oboe (pitched in C) and the cor anglais or English horn (pitched in F and plays a fifth lower than its written part).
