#Animation

PVs that contain identifiable bright, clashing or blurry colors. People subject to eye strain are advised to not watch these.
This tag can be applied to songs with a [content warning intro](https://vocadb.net/T/6436/content-warning-intro), title or description that contains an eye strain warning.

> Not to be mistaken with [vivid](https://vocadb.net/T/9442), which includes neon colors by themselves and songs *about* said colors, which do not necessarily cause eye strain.
Not to be mistaken with [flashing lights warning](https://vocadb.net/T/2913/flashing-lights-warning), which focuses on flashing, flickering and linked seizure risk.
