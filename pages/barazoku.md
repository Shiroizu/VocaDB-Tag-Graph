From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bara_(genre)):
>Bara (薔薇, lit. 'rose') is a colloquialism for a genre of Japanese art and media known within Japan as gay manga (ゲイ漫画) or gei komi (ゲイコミ, "gay comics").
The genre focuses on **male same-sex love**, as created primarily by **gay men** for a **gay male audience**.
Bara can vary in visual style and plot, but typically features **masculine men** with varying degrees of **muscle**, **body fat**, and **body hair**, akin to **bear** or **bodybuilding culture**.
While bara is typically **pornographic**, the genre has also depicted **romantic** and **autobiographical** subject material, as it acknowledges the varied reactions to **homosexuality** in modern **Japan**.
Bara is distinct from yaoi, a genre of Japanese media focusing on homoerotic relationships between male characters that historically has been created by and for women.
