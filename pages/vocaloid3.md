#Vocalists

Tag for Vocaloids using the Vocaloid3 engine.
VOCALOID3 is the third generation of VOCALOID.

This tag is primarily used to label voicebanks based on the Vocaloid3 engine. It may also be used for albums with Vocaloid3 remakes of songs, and for songs rendered with Vocaloid2 voicebanks imported into Vocaloid3 (V3Import).

>VOCALOID3 was formally announced mid-2011 at a special invitation only event. The release date was set for September 2011, however it was held back on several occasions until it was eventually released on October 21, 2011.
