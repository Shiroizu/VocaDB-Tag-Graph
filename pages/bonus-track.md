#Sources

Songs that are considered bonus tracks, either described that way by the artist or hidden after the official tracklist.

Also applies to albums with one or more bonus tracks.

When this tag is applied, the "bonus track" text in track title can usually be removed, or moved to alias.

___

> A bonus track (also known as a bonus cut or bonus) is a piece of music which has been included as an extra.
This may be done as a marketing promotion, or for other reasons.
It is not uncommon to include singles, B-sides, live recordings, and demo recordings as bonus tracks on re-issues of old albums, where those tracks weren't originally included.
Online music stores allow buyers to create their own albums by selecting songs themselves; bonus tracks may be included if a customer buys a whole album rather than just one or two songs from the artist.
The song is not necessarily free nor is it available as a stand-alone download, adding also to the incentive to buy the complete album.
In contrast to hidden tracks, bonus tracks are included on track listings and usually do not have a gap of silence between other album tracks.
Bonus tracks on CD or vinyl albums are common in Japan for releases by European and North American artists; since importing international copies of the album can be cheaper than buying a domestically released version, Japanese releases often feature bonus tracks to incentivize domestic purchase.
