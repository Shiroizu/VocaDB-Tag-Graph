Hyakki Yagyou, variation: Hyakki Yakou, (百鬼夜行, "Night Parade of One Hundred Demons") is an idiom in Japanese folklore. Sometimes an orderly procession, other times a riot, it refers to an uncontrolled horde of countless numbers of supernatural creatures known as oni and youkai. As a terrifying eruption of the supernatural world into our own, it is similar (though not precisely equivalent) to the concept of pandemonium in English.
