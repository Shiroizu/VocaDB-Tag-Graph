Nico Nico Movie Maker is a software package released by Internet Co. in 2008 that is designed for creating and uploading .swf files to Nico Nico Douga. Videos created with Nico Nico Movie Maker have "nm" in their video IDs instead of the usual "sm".

The software was retired in 2015 due to the broad retirement of Flash compatibility. In 2018, all .swf files on Nico Nico Douga were converted to MP4 files, losing all unique functionality in the process.

Applicable to:
- song PVs that were made with Nico Nico Movie Maker;
- artists that often use Nico Nico Movie Maker for their songs.
