#Genres

The most melancholy of the Doom Metal styles, Funeral Doom takes the depressive atmosphere and slowed tempos to an extreme. Distorted chords are played at a dirge-like pace, often accompanied by mournful keyboards and vocals that are pushed back in the mix. The vocals become dreamlike chants or hushed growls in an effort to create the most oppressive and claustrophobic atmosphere possible. This sound was first popularized by Thergothon, with their moody atmosphere and dreamy mixing influencing many artists in the genre. Bands like Skepticism refine the traditional sound of the genre, and bands like Esoteric and Mournful Congregation often mix Funeral Doom Metal with Death Doom Metal elements.
