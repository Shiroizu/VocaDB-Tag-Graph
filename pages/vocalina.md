#Vocalists

VOCALINA was a free Korean singing synthesizer software by TGENS. It was released in October 2011 and was shut down in October 2018. Because it was officially discontinued, it can now be downloaded from abandonware sites. 

VORA was the first voicebank released for VOCALINA, while Khylin was released with the 2.0 update. Conversely, VORA was the first bank to be retired, with 2.2 marking her last appearance in the program.
