#Genres

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibuya-kei):

>Shibuya-kei is an eclectic form of pop music and an aesthetic that flourished in the mid to late 1990s. Emerging as Japanese retail music from the Shibuya district of Tokyo, artists purveyed a cut-and-paste style that was inspired by previous genres based on kitsch, fusion, and artifice. The genre was strongly influenced by 1960s culture and Western pop music. [...] Flipper's Guitar, a duo led by Kenji Ozawa and Keigo Oyamada (Cornelius), formed the bedrock of the genre and influenced all of its groups, but the most prominent Shibuya-kei band was Pizzicato Five, who fused mainstream J-pop with a mix of jazz, soul, and lounge influences.

Shibuya-kei can also be described as a cross between J-pop (sometimes [indie pop](https://vocadb.net/T/4615/indie-pop) or [synthpop](https://vocadb.net/T/4664/synthpop)) and [jazz](https://vocadb.net/T/467/jazz) (or related genres, like [bossa nova](https://vocadb.net/T/46/bossa-nova)).
