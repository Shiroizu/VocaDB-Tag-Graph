#Themes

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking):
> Stalking is unwanted or repeated surveillance by an individual or group towards another person. Stalking behaviors are interrelated to harassment and intimidation and may include following the victim in person or monitoring them.

This tag is for songs that are about a stalker, or being stalked. This can also be used for artists making songs/related to songs about stalkers or albums with a surplus of songs with this theme. Often, but not always, overlaps with the [ヤンデレ](https://vocadb.net/T/489/yandere) tag.
