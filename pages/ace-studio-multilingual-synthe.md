#Vocalists

A feature of [ACE Studio](https://vocadb.net/T/8863/ace-virtual-singer) that allows all voicebanks to read Chinese, Japanese, English phonemes, regardless of what language the voicebank was recorded in.

Note that voicebanks should still be tagged with the languages they were recorded for, instead of the languages this feature allows.
