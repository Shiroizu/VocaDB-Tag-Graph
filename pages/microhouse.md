#Genres

'Microhouse', 'Buftech' or sometimes just 'Minimal', is a subgenre of 'House music' strongly influenced by minimalism and 1990s techno.
Characteristics:
A noticeable difference between microhouse and house is the replacement of typical house kick drums, hi-hats and other drum machine samples with clicks, static, glitches, and small bits of noise, which more often than not are stretched out and last longer in drops. Microhouse artists often experiment with different forms of sampling to achieve this effect. One characteristic feature of microhouse is the use of sampling: extremely short ('micro') samples of the human voice, musical instruments, everyday noises and computer created wave patterns are arranged to form complex melodies.
