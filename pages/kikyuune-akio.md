Release Date: August 23, 2009

Likes: energy drinks, hobby shops, taking things apart
Dislikes: hot weather, being asked too many questions

Akio is Aiko’s older (by design) brother. He is a timid, though very clever, young man who loves nothing more than to learn how things work. He is a tinkerer and can is quite good at repairing anything from a steam engine to a laptop computer; the only problem being he rarely repairs anything. Instead, Akio gets curious and takes the object apart entirely, usually putting it back together with strange or disastrous results.

Akio happens to be dead, after being murdered by one of Aiko’s rogue fan derivatives. But whenever he attempts to tell anyone in the family that he’s a ghost, he gets interrupted somehow.

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
