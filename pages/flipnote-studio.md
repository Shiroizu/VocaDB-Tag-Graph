#Animation

>**Flipnote Studio**, originally released in **Japan** as **Moving Memo (うごくメモ帳, Ugoku Memochō)**, was a free downloadable application available through the **Nintendo DSi's DSiWare** digital distribution service.
Developed by **Nintendo EAD Tokyo**, **Flipnote Studio** allowed the user to create both word- and picture-based notes with the stylus, add sound, and put them together to create frame-by-frame flipbook-style animations.
In prior English-language keynote addresses and conferences, the application was referred to as Moving Notepad by **Nintendo**, and was announced at **E3 2009** officially as **Flipnote Studio**.
It was released in **Japan** on **December 24, 2008**, in **North America** on **August 12, 2009**, and in **Europe** and **Australia** on **August 14, 2009**.

>**Flipnote Hatena** is the name of both the portion of the **Flipnote Studio** application that connects to the **Flipnote Hatena** website as well as the website itself (the Japanese version of the program differentiates between the two, but not the English version).
**Flipnote Hatena** was shut down on **May 31, 2013**.

>**Nintendo** announced that the Flipnotes on **Flipnote Hatena** would be transferred to the new online service for **Moving Notepad/Flipnote Studio 3D**.
The **DSi** Flipnotes were accessible from the **Nintendo DSi Gallery**, a free-to-access section of the upcoming **Flipnote Gallery: World**.
Services for **Flipnote Gallery: World** and **Nintendo DSi Library** were both ended on **April 1, 2018**.
