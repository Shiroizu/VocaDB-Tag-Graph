#Genres

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_trance):

>A typical track consists of three elements, though later tracks labeled vocal trance may not include all of them. A track begins with an intro of progressive beats. The melodic part starts incrementally, combining vocals, usually female, a melodic sound (for the most part high pitched and fast), and a bass pattern. Towards the end of the track, the melody fades out and the intro rhythm returns, usually with some minor changes.
