#Vocalists

UTSU is a Japanese singing synthesis frontend program created by [titinko](https://vocadb.net/Ar/115440) that was originally released back in [September 22th, 2017](https://github.com/titinko/utsu/commit/8a812fea4a115d1969a28d8d08dd25f6fff2cdbf). It is designed to be compatible with UTAU, allowing for banks in the latter program to be easily imported into UTSU. Despite predominantly being an import system, UTSU does actually come with its own bank: [Iona](https://vocadb.net/Ar/114458), who was made by the creator of UTSU themself.
