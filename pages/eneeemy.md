#Series

A song series organized by [Aruse Chika](https://vocadb.net/Ar/77462).

From [vocakel @Twitter](https://twitter.com/vocalokel/status/1505028596527734788):
>“Not first-year students getting to know each other for the first time nor third-year students graduating together.
We asked each student to write a song under the theme of the "students of class 2E".”
