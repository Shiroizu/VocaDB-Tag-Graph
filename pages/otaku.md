#Themes

A Japanese term (おたく, オタク, or ヲタク) for people with consuming interests, particularly in anime and manga.
In modern Japanese slang, the term otaku is mostly equivalent to "geek" or "nerd", but in a more derogatory manner than used in the West. However, it can relate to any fan of any particular theme, topic, hobby or form of entertainment.
