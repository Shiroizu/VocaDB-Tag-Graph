#Genres

>Eurobeat is either a form of the British dance-pop variant of Eurodisco or Hi-NRG-driven Italo disco music that both developed in 1980s. In the United States, Eurobeat was sometimes marketed as Hi-NRG and for a short while shared this term with the very early freestyle music hits. Italo disco was often referred to as Eurobeat, probably due to the negative connotations of the word "disco" in the minds of the United States' population in the 1980s."Eurobeat" is also directly related to the Japanese Para Para dance culture as it influences many song and business decisions.
