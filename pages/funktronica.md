#Genres

Funktronica is a subgenre of Electronic music originating in Eastern North America around the turn of the 21st century, combining musical trends of Synth Funk and Italo-Disco.

Similar to Nu-Disco in some aspects (sharing elements of italo-disco), funktronica is comparable to synth funk, but contains both slightly faster tempos than nu-disco and is less melodic.

This subgenre employs samplers/sequencers, electric bass guitar (played in the slap technique), talkbox, vocoder, electric guitar, keyboards and synthesizers.

Funktronica's rhythm typically consists of a simple 4 beat drum pattern, dividing each of the four beats into two: Kick – Snare - Kick – Snare, similar to Funk and Rock music. Notably, though, ride cymbals of the drum kit are not used often. Using drums as such simple accompaniment, funky bass lines usually provide more rhythmic content.
