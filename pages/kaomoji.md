#Themes

>An **emoticon**, short for "**emotion icon**", also known simply as an **emote**, is a **pictorial representation of a facial expression using characters**—usually punctuation marks, numbers, and letters—to express a person's feelings, mood or reaction, or as a time-saving method.
(...)
Emoticons were the precursors to modern **emojis**, which have been in a state of continuous development for a variety of digital platforms.
(...)
They are much like emoticons, except **emoji** are **pictures rather than typographic approximations**; the term "emoji" in the strict sense refers to such pictures which can be represented as **encoded characters**, but it is sometimes applied to **messaging stickers** by extension.
