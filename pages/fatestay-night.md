A version of Fate/stay night rated for ages 15 and up titled Fate/stay night Réalta Nua (Irish for "new star"), which features the Japanese voice actors from the anime series, was released in 2007 for the PlayStation 2 and later for download on Windows as a trilogy covering the three main storylines: Fate, Unlimited Blade Works and Heaven's Feel.
Réalta Nua was also ported to the PlayStation Vita, iOS and Android.
