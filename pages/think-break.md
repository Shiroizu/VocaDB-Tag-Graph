#Composition

>The Think break is a drum break that has been widely sampled in popular music. It comes from the 1972 song "Think (About It)" by the American soul singer Lyn Collins, written and produced by James Brown. The drum break was performed by John "Jabo" Starks.

One of the drum samples is most commonly sampled in many songs (mainly hip hop, breakbeat, and Baltimore club) alongside the amen break.
