From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuffed_toy):
>A stuffed toy is a toy with an outer fabric sewn from a textile and stuffed with flexible material. They are known by many names, such as plushies, stuffed animals, plush toys, or stuffies. In Britain and Australia, they may be called soft toys or cuddly toys. The toy originated from Germany in the late 19th century and gained popularity following the creation of the teddy bear in 1903.
