#Copyrights

Loona (stylized as LOOΠΔ; Korean: 이달의 소녀, romanized: Idarui Sonyeo; Japanese: 今月の少女, romanized: Kongetsu no Shōjo, lit. 'Girl of the Month') was a South Korean girl group formed by Blockberry Creative. The group was introduced to the public through a pre-debut project which began in October 2016, where each of the 12 members were revealed in a periodic fashion by releasing a promotional single over the following 18 months. They debuted as a full ensemble with the extended play ++ (2018), supported by the lead single "Favorite" and the title track "Hi High". After a legal battle that began in November 2022 and lasted until June 2023, the group has been on indefinite hiatus. Currently, they have moved to seperate projects; Chuu, Loossemble, Yves, and ARTMS.
