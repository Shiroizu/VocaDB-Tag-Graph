#Derivative

His ears are speakers that cannot be detached. He has a fox tail that also can't be detached. He likes going to the gym and listening to music, especially metal and rock. He cares deeply about his brother and is very protective. He's pretty quiet and can seem negative at times but that's just because he's emo. Kuudere/tsundere. His character item is a ghost pepper.

His name is a play-on: Zan(Ji-tsune) which sounds like fox in Japanese (Kitsune).

This voice works best with soft or deeper pitched songs.
