#Sources

>BMS is a **file format for rhythm action games**, devised by Urao Yane in 1998. The format was originally developed as a format specific for a **simulator of the game Beatmania** by KONAMI, and currently the term BMS is widely used to describe the whole **Beatmania simulating game system**.
The acronym has been confirmed by Urao Yane to be **Be-Music Source** in the official BMS format specification.

___

>Most BMS songs are **original songs made specially for the game**, because the BMS format requires the sounds that compose the music to be separated into small pieces, thus making it hard to use preexisting songs to be made into a BMS.
Currently most BMS songs are distributed in BMS events, where usually several artists publish their songs and compete for scores. The largest BMS event is the **BMS of Fighters (BOF)** held by AOiRO_MANBOW where more than 250 songs are presented each year.
