#Vocalists

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scat_singing):
>In vocal jazz, scat singing is vocal improvisation with wordless vocables, nonsense syllables or without words at all. In scat singing, the singer improvises melodies and rhythms using the voice as an instrument rather than a speaking medium.
