Character creators are a popular form of in-browser game, with many a website dedicated to them. The most popular dress-up site is [Picrew](https://vocadb.net/T/7746), but others exist, such as [DollDivine](https://www.dolldivine.com/) or [Azalea's Dress up Dolls](https://www.azaleasdolls.com/index.php).

This tag is for:

- Voicebanks that use a character creator as one of their main, official avatars
- Videos that use art from character creators
