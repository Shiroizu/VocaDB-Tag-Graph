#Derivative

Chikune Shem is a female configuration of [Chikune Kenta](https://vocadb.net/Ar/44551)'s voicebank achieved by setting the gender factor to -18.

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
