A **hostess club** is a type of night club found primarily in Japan which employs mostly female staff and caters to men seeking drinks and attentive conversation. **Host clubs** are a similar type of establishment where mostly male staff attend to women. Host and hostess clubs are considered part of mizu shōbai (lit. 'water trade'), the night-time entertainment business in Japan.
