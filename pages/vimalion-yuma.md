#Animation

Design for the Synthesizer V [Yuma](https://vocadb.net/Ar/109074) created by the group [VIMALION PROJECT](https://vocadb.net/Ar/110180).

Illustration by [rice](https://vocadb.net/Ar/69939) from the [VIMALION website](https://vimalion.pro/).

> A fun-loving, mischievous young man who never seems to be up to any good. Surprisingly mature when you least expect it.
