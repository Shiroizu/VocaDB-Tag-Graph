#Copyrights

>Kyary Pamyu Pamyu (きゃりーぱみゅぱみゅ), is a Japanese model and singer. Her public image is associated with Japan's kawaisa and decora culture centered in the Harajuku neighborhood of Tokyo. Her music is produced by musician [Yasutaka Nakata](http://vocadb.net/Ar/588) of electronic music duo Capsule. 
*---from Wikipedia.*

Note: she has a tag rather than vocalist entry because she doesn't make her own music, and therefore she has no music on VocaDB, but some tracks were originally performed by her.
