#Derivative

"Cybergirl is a Vocaloid specialized in the Hyperpop/Pop Genres. She is voiced by Cyber Diva [hehe]."

Cybergirl is a derivative created by Kai Ane. Cybergirl is based on the voice of [CYBER DIVA](https://vocadb.net/Ar/31020).

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
