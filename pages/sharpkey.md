#Vocalists

Sharpkey was a Chinese and Japanese singing synthesis engine made solely by [Boxstar](https://vocadb.net/Ar/52000). Released on July 21st, 2016 with its first vocal, [Huan Xiao Yi](https://vocadb.net/Ar/51886), the program had seven voicebanks released for it before its shut-down on February 19th, 2019. Some of the vocals planned for Sharpkey were instead released later as DeepVocal banks.

Note that most Sharpkey voicebanks are compatible with the successor program DeepVocal; the exceptions to this are [Suoyin Rila](https://vocadb.net/Ar/69927), who later received a proper [DeepVocal voicebank](https://vocadb.net/Ar/120447), and [Akane Inari](https://vocadb.net/Ar/68031), who has yet to be updated.
