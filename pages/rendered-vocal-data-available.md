#Distribution

This tag applies when that there is official vocal data rendered as an _audio file_ (WAV, MP3 etc.) available for download.

Not to be confused with [tuned vocal data available](https://vocadb.net/T/10898).
May overlap with [stem data distribution (VocaColle)](https://vocadb.net/T/9534), prefer the event-specific tag when applicable.
