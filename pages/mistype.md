#Editor_notes

Tag for songs with a mistype (an **unintentional** **error**) in the **song title** or in the **artist/voicebank** credit.

**Both the original (incorrect) and a corrected title should be added to the VocaDB entry.** For example, if the song was titled "Amtosphere" the song entry should include "Atmosphere" as an **alias**. If the mistype is not obvious, mention it in the description.

If the original typo is edited to no longer be present in any official media, deleted or otherwise, the incorrect title can be removed from the song entry along with this tag. **If the song is never corrected, then the "typo" may be intentional and should be marked under the ["sic" tag](https://vocadb.net/T/10600/sic) instead.**

For songs with incorrect voicebank credits, the correct voicebank credit can be applied if you are certain about it. (make sure to mention this in the edit notes/description).
