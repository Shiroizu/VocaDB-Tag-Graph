#Vocalists

The Standard (non-AI) versions of voicebanks from version 1 updated with re-trained models, effectively converting it into AI-based voices. The updated voice will have the same specifications as the compatibility updates for other version 1 voices. They are only usable in Synthesizer V 2.
