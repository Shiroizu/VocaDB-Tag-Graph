#Animation

An alternate, white- or winter-themed design for Hatsune Miku, sometimes showing her with snowflakes on her hair or clothes.

From [SnowMiku.com](https://snowmiku.com/2022/info_snowmiku_en.html):
>"SNOW MIKU" is the character who enlivens the wintery Hokkaido.
>The design is based on "a pure white snow sculpture of 'Hatsune Miku,'" that was created for "Sapporo Snow Festival 2010." Since then, a "SNOW MIKU" festival using "SNOW MIKU" as a main character has been held in Hokkaido every year.
>The costume design for "SNOW MIKU" is selected in an online competition on different themes every year.
>Nowadays, "SNOW MIKU" has been serving as an ambassador for various events to enliven Hokkaido, and has collaborated with other characters and companies to this day.
