From [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat):
>Meat is animal tissue, often muscle, that is eaten as food. Humans have hunted and farmed other animals for meat since prehistory. The Neolithic Revolution allowed the domestication of animals, including chickens, sheep, goats, pigs, horses, and cattle, starting around 11,000 years ago. Since then, selective breeding has enabled farmers to produce meat with the qualities desired by producers and consumers.

Art by [Samsap](https://twitter.com/samsap_). It depicts [Hatsune Miku](https://vocadb.net/Ar/1) with her hair being in the form of meat, cutting one of her pigtails into small pieces of meat with scissors to be added in a bowl of soup.
