#Sources

An umbrella tag for technologies that generate “Prompt vocal” songs with uncontrollable vocals.

Note that song entries made **exclusively** using these technologies **should not** be added: [wiki/content-policy/songs](https://wiki.vocadb.net/docs/other-guidelines/content-policy#songs).

Hints/Patterns that may indicate AI songs:
- Description or tags do not mention which voice synth was used
- Voice synth sounds like "Miku" but at the same time does not sound like "Miku" etc.
- Voice synth is missing specific engine or synth noise, sound or "behavior"
- Image/Thumbnail is AI generated (AI art)
- Account has a large amount of uploads in a short time

[Newgrounds also hosts a guide to identifying AI generated music.](https://www.newgrounds.com/wiki/help-information/site-moderation/how-to-detect-ai-audio)
