#Vocalists

VocalWriter is a synthesizer for Mac OS that was originally released by KAE Labs on [April 6th, 1998](https://web.archive.org/web/19981202065609/http://www.kaelabs.com/Press.htm). It is capable of synthesizing both instruments and English vocals. VocalWriter has seven regular vocal synths -- [Abe](https://vocadb.net/Ar/115007), [Andy](https://vocadb.net/Ar/113406), [Desmond](https://vocadb.net/Ar/113492), [Richard](https://vocadb.net/Ar/115008), [Robert](https://vocadb.net/Ar/113410), [Sarah](https://vocadb.net/Ar/73841), and [Tracy](https://vocadb.net/Ar/113407) -- and a multitude of instrument-vocals, A.K.A. synthetic non-vocal instruments with "dynamic vocal tracts". (Think of the latter as like an early precursor to [inanimate UTAU](https://vocadb.net/T/7018).) An upgraded Mac OS X version, VocalWriter 2.0, was released on [July 17th, 2005](https://web.archive.org/web/20051023171544/http://kaelabs.com/press_release.htm), and with it came unrestricted English phonemes. 

KAE Labs became defunct after Mark Cecys's death. VocalWriter can now be downloaded from abandonware websites.
