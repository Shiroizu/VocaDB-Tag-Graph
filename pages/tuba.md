#Instruments

The tuba is a large brass instruments with conical tubing and its bell facing upwards. It's the largest and lowest-sounding member of the brass section and has booming sound. Ironically, the name "tuba" is Latin for ["trumpet"](https://vocadb.net/T/2812/trumpet).
 
There are three types of modern tuba commonly used: the contrabass tuba, the bass tuba, and the euphonium (tenor tuba). Modern tuba may be pitched in B♭, C, E♭, or F, but it plays as its written in bass clef. The only exception is in British brass bands, where its parts uses treble clef and played lower than the notation (B♭ contrabass tubas sound two octaves and a major second lower, while E♭ bass tubas sound one octave and a major sixth lower).
