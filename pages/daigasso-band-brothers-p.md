#Games

A music video game developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 3DS in Japan. The game was released on November 14, 2013 and officially discontinued on May 1, 2020. By the end of its journey, the game boasted an impressive number of more than 4000 songs in its song list.

The game is notable for being the only game in the *Daigasso! Band Brothers* series to implement VOCALOID technology. Users are made to create their own VOCALOID using their voice and the results would be used in gameplay. The VOCALOID engine within the game is a lite version of the [VOCALOID3](https://vocadb.net/T/475) engine and renders the voice in real-time during gameplay. While [VY1](https://vocadb.net/Ar/117) was the default voice, the following VOCALOIDs were implemented in the game as being "live artists":
* [Aoki Lapis](https://vocadb.net/Ar/156)
* [GUMI](https://vocadb.net/Ar/3)
* [Kamui Gackupo](https://vocadb.net/Ar/12)
* [ZOLA PROJECT](https://vocadb.net/Ar/59058)
* [galaco](https://vocadb.net/Ar/1777)
* [MAYU](https://vocadb.net/Ar/1766)
* [Sachiko](https://vocadb.net/Ar/39620)
* [ARSLOID](https://vocadb.net/Ar/36129)
