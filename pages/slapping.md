#Instruments

From [Wikipedia]():
>Slapping and popping are ways to produce percussive sounds on a double bass or bass guitar by bouncing strings against the fretboard. On bass guitar, slap and pop involves striking the strings with the bony part of the thumb or popping notes by pulling a string until it snaps against the fingerboard. It is often used in disco, funk, and other genres. On the double bass, slapping refers to pulling strings until they snap against the fingerboard in rockabilly and psychobilly. Slapping is a technique also adopted by acoustic and electric fingerstyle guitarists.
