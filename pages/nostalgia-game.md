#Games

Nostalgia (ノスタルジア) is an Arcade Game, developed by Konami as part of their BEMANI line of Rhythm Games and available in Japan and select parts of the Asia Pacific. The game was originally made to convert BeatStream cabinets, as BeatStream's service was terminated in February 2017, although a dedicated cabinet made specifically for the game is also available.
