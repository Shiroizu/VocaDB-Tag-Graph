#Derivative

Nagone Makoto is a genderswap based on [Nagone Mako](https://vocadb.net/Ar/9394).

Makoto's voice is achieved by applying the parameter g+25 to 30 to any voicebank of [Nagone Mako](https://vocadb.net/Ar/9394).

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
