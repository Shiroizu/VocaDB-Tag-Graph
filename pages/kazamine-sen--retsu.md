#Derivative

Vocaloid derivatives created by Ritsu, based on Kagamine Rin and Len respectively and themed around wind. Sen's name comes from the word 旋風 ("senpuu", whirlwind), Retsu's -- from the word 烈風 ("reppuu", gale). Their surname was originally supposed to be 風音 ("Kazane"), but was changed to "Kazamine" so that it bears more resemblance to "Kagamine".

Character items: pinwheel (Sen) and accordion (Retsu).
Their height, age and weight are equal to those of Rin and Len.
Apparently, they were born somewhere near the sea.
