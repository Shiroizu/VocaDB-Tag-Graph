Keko was created by [CircusP](https://vocadb.net/Ar/919) on April 19th, 2009. She is referred to as a "VOCATAU2" because she was re-colored version Kasane Teto who is an UTAU, and a voice edit of Kagamine Len who is VOCALOID2.

Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
