#Sources

Originally used to refer to all kinds of digitally assembled music in home computing environments (or DAWs). With the advancements in high quality sampling and processing, it is now used to make a distinction between professional production and the limited capabilities of beginner or hobby music making.

The auto-sequences used for DTM often produce a distinctive sound, usually prominent for UTAU works.
