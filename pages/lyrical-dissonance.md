#Lyrics

Ever heard a super cheery song with the most terrifying lyrics imaginable? Then ta-da, you've heard something with "lyrical dissonance". The term refers to songs where the mood of the lyrics and the mood of the music itself mismatch, creating this sense of bewildering dissonance between the two juxtaposed atmospheres. This is most commonly seen with cutesy J-pop songs with sad or dark lyrics, but any sort of atmospheric incongruity works.

Not to be confused with the musical term ["dissonance"](https://vocadb.net/T/8810), though they may overlap.
