#Genres

Original Pilipino Music, now more commonly termed OPM, originally referred only to a genre of Philippine pop songs, mostly ballads, that became popular after the collapse of its predecessor, the Manila sound of the late 1970s. Currently, the term "OPM" has been a catch-all description for all popular music composed and performed by Filipinos, originating from the Philippines.
