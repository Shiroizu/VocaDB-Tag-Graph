#Editor_notes

Use this tag when you can't find the release date of an album, song or voice synth (or if it is unconfirmed/incomplete).

- Albums and voicebanks that were never released should be tagged with "cancelled" instead.
- Private voicebanks that were never distributed to the public should be tagged with "private voicebank".
