#Themes

>A tooth is a hard, calcified structure found in the jaws (or mouths) of many vertebrates and used to break down food.
Some animals, particularly carnivores and omnivores, also use teeth to help with capturing or wounding prey, tearing food, for defensive purposes, to intimidate other animals often including their own, or to carry prey or their young.
