#Animation

Design for the Synthesizer V [Felicia](https://vocadb.net/Ar/147231) created by the group [VIMALION PROJECT](https://vocadb.net/Ar/110180).

Illustration by [rice](https://vocadb.net/Ar/69939) from the [VIMALION website](https://vimalion.pro/).

>  A self-assured woman with a rich presence. Surprisingly old-fashioned, with a tendency for the dramatic.
