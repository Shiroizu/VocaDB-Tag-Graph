> _Heavy Metal L-Gaim_ (_重戦機（ヘビーメタル）エルガイム_, literally "_Heavy Fighting Machine L-Gaim_") is a mecha anime television series. _Heavy Metal L-Gaim_ takes place in the Pentagona System, a solar system made up of five planets. Oldna Poseidal, the legendary emperor from the planet Gastogal leads his 24 Temple Knights from planet to planet until all have fallen under his control. His final victory is on the planet Mizum in 3975 when he defeats Kamon Walha V, ruler of the Yaman Clan. Kamon hides his heir, Kamon Myroad on the planet Mizum with the legendary white mecha, L-Gaim. Fifteen years later, now grown up and known as Daba Myroad, he leads a rebellion to free the planets of Pentagona from Poseidal's grasp. _(from Wikipedia)_
