#Genres

>Dubstep is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in South London, England. The music generally features sparse, syncopated drum and percussion patterns with bass lines that contain prominent sub bass frequencies. The music website Allmusic has described Dubstep's overall sound as "tightly coiled productions with overwhelming bass lines and reverberant drum patterns, clipped samples, and occasional vocals."
