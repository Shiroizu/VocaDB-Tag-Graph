#Series

いつもと違う、大きな音が鳴り響いた。
その音を耳にしたのは一人の少女、ロア。治療のためこの場所に長年暮らしている。
音の方向はどうやらロアが立ち入り禁止とされている部屋からのようだ。しかしこの場所にはロア一人。他にここで暮らす人たちは皆外出の最中。

意を決して部屋の中に入ることにしたロアは自分と同じ姿のコウと出会う。コウは身体はとても無事と言える状況ではなく、ピクリともしない。

An unusual, loud sound had rung out.
The sound was heard by a lone girl; Loa. She has been residing in this place for many years for medical treatment.
The direction the sound had come from seemed to be a room of which Loa was forbidden from entering. However, Loa is alone in this place. All of the other people who reside here are not home.

Loa, who had made up her mind and entered the room, meets Kou, who looks very similar in appearance to her. Kou's body is in no condition to be considered "safe", body not even doing as much as twitching.

Concerned, Loa reached out to touch Kou when she was grabbed by what appeared to be a disgusting arm. The feeling of something coming towards her from Kou's body overcame her before an eerie arm grew from Loa's head.
