The video merged a Japanese pop song with an animated cartoon cat with a Pop-Tart for a torso, flying through space, and leaving a rainbow trail behind it. The video ranked at number 5 on the list of most viewed YouTube videos in 2011.

On **April 2, 2011**, the GIF animation of the cat was posted by 25-year-old **[Christopher Torres](https://vocadb.net/Ar/67056)** of Dallas, Texas, who uses the name "prguitarman", on his website LOL-Comics.

The original version of the song, "**[Nyanyanyanyanyanyanya!](https://vocadb.net/S/123)**", was uploaded by user "**[daniwellP](https://vocadb.net/Ar/83)**" to NicoNicoDouga on **July 25, 2010**. The song features **[Hatsune Miku](https://vocadb.net/Ar/1)**.

Producer "**[ももももP](https://vocadb.net/Ar/894)**" published a cover version of the song using the UTAU **[Momone Momo](https://vocadb.net/Ar/598)** to NicoNicoDouga on **January 31, 2011*. The cover was named "**Nyan Cat**" and it was later used in the popular YouTube video.
