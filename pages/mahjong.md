#Themes

A tile-based game that was developed during the Qing dynasty in China and has spread throughout the world since the early 20th century. It is commonly played by four players. 

[The picture](https://piapro.jp/t/W1oI), however, only depicts one player: [Kaito](https://vocadb.net/Ar/71), who appears to be gambling with ice cream-themed tiles. The art is by [炒太郎](https://vocadb.net/Ar/78966).
