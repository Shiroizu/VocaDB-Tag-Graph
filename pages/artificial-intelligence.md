#Themes

Songs and characters that represent computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.

For AI voicebanks, please check the [related tag](https://vocadb.net/T/8451/ai-voicebank). This tag is specifically for entries themed around AI and artificial intelligence, while the other one is for the real life neuro-network voicebanks. While they may overlap, the differences between the two tags are important.

Art by [Emilio](https://vocadb.net/Ar/2613). It depicts [Kaito](https://vocadb.net/Ar/71) directing a blank-but-intense stare towards the camera. Across the screen, sweeping over his eye and curling around his raised finger, is a bright blue line of light, seemingly emanating from his robotic eye.
