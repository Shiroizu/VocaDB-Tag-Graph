#Instruments

The saxophone, often shortened as "sax", is a single-reed woodwind instrument with a body made of brass. It was created by [Adolphe Sax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolphe_Sax) in 1840s with the aim to combine the best qualities of woodwind and brass instruments. It's a regular member of military and concert bands, but only rarely appears in orchestras.

The saxophone has several sizes and keys, but the most commonly used today are the B♭ soprano, the E♭ alto, the B♭ tenor, and the E♭ baritone.
