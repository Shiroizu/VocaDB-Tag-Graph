#Derivative

Daisy Libra is a derivative and younger sister of the UTAU [Iris Libra](https://vocadb.net/Ar/41669). Her voice is achieved when setting the gender flag to -15 to -20.
Gender: Female
Age: 12
Height: 4' 8"(142 cm)
Weight: 90lbs(41 kg)

Daisy is Iris's little sister who on the outside seems to be very bratty and self-centered, often putting her older sisters wants and needs aside to satisfy her own. But the reality is that Daisy loves her sister dearly and just has some more growing up to do. And while she finds some of Iris's hobbies and mannerisms a bit obnoxious she does enjoy hanging out with her older sister from time to time and hopes that maybe someday she can be just like her.

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
