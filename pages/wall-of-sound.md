#Genres

> A popular music production technique, developed in the 1960s, in which a number of musicians perform the same instruments or parts in unison and the resulting sound is re-recorded in an echo chamber.

May also refer to equivalent digital production techniques that result in dense layers of vocals and/or instruments.
