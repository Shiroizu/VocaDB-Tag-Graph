#Vocalists

The highest **female** voice typically between C4 and C6.

___

>A **soprano** is a type of classical **female** singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types.
The **soprano's** vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C4) = 261 Hz to "high A" (A5) = 880 Hz in choral music, or to "soprano C" (C6, two octaves above middle C) = 1046 Hz or higher in operatic music.
In four-part chorale style harmony, the **soprano** takes the highest part, which often encompasses the melody.
The **soprano** voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano.

>A **sopranist** (also, **sopranista** or **male soprano**) is a **male** singer who is able to sing in the vocal tessitura of a **soprano** usually through the use of falsetto or head voice vocal production.
This voice type is a specific kind of **countertenor**.
In rare cases an adult man may be able to sing in the **soprano** range using his normal or modal voice (high chest voice) and not falsetto due to endocrinological reasons, like Radu Marian, or as a result of a larynx that has not completely developed as is allegedly the case of Michael Maniaci.
