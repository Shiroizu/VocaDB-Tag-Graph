From Wikipedia:
> The _coelacanths_ are members of a now-rare order of fish (Coelacanthiformes) that includes two extant species in the genus Latimeria: the West Indian Ocean coelacanth primarily found near the Comoro Islands off the east coast of Africa and the Indonesian coelacanth. The name originates from the Permian genus Coelacanthus, which was the first scientifically named coelacanth.
