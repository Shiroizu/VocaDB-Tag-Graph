#Vocalists

The resampler is the replaceable back-end engine that [UTAU](https://vocadb.net/T/447) uses to process and synthesize vocals.

UTAU comes with `resampler.exe` and `resampler.dll`. Other resamplers have been developed, even by [Ameya/Ayame](https://vocadb.net/Ar/14553) (UTAU's developer).

OpenUtau comes with `WORLDLINE-R`.
