#Themes

A meteorological phenomenon that is caused by reflection, refraction and dispersion of light in water droplets resulting in a spectrum of light appearing in the sky.
It takes the form of a multicoloured circular arc.
Rainbows caused by sunlight always appear in the section of sky directly opposite the Sun.

- This tag should be used if a (real) rainbow is visible or if the word is in the name/title of the entry. For rainbow colors in any form, the "colorful" tag should be used instead.
