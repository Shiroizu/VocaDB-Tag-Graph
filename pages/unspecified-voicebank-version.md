#Editor_notes

Tag for song entries having unconfirmed voicebank versions in which the engine versions are not specified (Gakupo Power (V3 or V4?), for example).

In this case, you should mention the missing information in the notes/description field and generally use the "base" voicebank version. For example, when it is known the singer is "Gakupo Power" but not which version, you should use the original [Kamui Gakupo Power entry](http://vocadb.net/Ar/1763)  (in this case, his VOCALOID3 release) together with a note and this tag.
