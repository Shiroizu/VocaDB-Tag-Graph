#Genres

Bossa nova is a genre of Brazilian music, which developed and was popularized in the 1950s and 1960s and is today one of the best-known Brazilian music genres abroad. A lyrical fusion of samba and jazz, bossa nova acquired a large following in the 1960s, initially among young musicians and college students. Bossa nova is most commonly performed on the nylon-string classical guitar, played with the fingers rather than with a pick. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bossa_nova#Instruments)).

__IMPORTANT__: not to be confused with [VOCANOVA](https://vocadb.net/T/512/vocanova) (rhythm game).
