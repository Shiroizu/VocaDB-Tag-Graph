#Series

KarenT special event featuring 13 chosen works.

Good morning - A new bright morning
The music of sunlight shines all day today
Good night - A quiet night waiting for tomorrow
Faint sound of music embraces the whole day
Music is always with you at the beginning and the end of the day.
Here are the songs for you, "Good morning, Good night." - KarenT
