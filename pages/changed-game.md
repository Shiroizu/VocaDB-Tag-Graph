Changed is a game created by DragonSnow (With Shizi serving as the creator of the soundtrack). It was released on Steam on April 5th, 2018. The story revolves around Colin, a human trapped in a mysterious laboratory not being able to remember how he got there, with the objective to escape the lab persevering through all the threats that await him during his escape. The game was created in RPG Maker VX and it features a lot of interactivity with objects in rooms and "death" scenes revolving around transformation or "Transfurmation" (or "tf" for short)
