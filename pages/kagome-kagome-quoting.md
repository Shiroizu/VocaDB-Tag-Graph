#Themes

For songs that have lines from "Kagome Kagome", a Japanese children's song, or reference it somehow (lyrics with minor deviations, same melody pattern).

>Kagome Kagome (かごめかごめ, or 籠目籠目) is a Japanese children's game and the song associated with it. One player is chosen as the Oni (literally demon or ogre, but similar to the concept of "it" in tag) and sits blindfolded (or with their eyes covered). The other children join hands and walk in circles around the Oni while chanting the song for the game. When the song stops, the Oni tries to name the person standing directly behind them.

>The song is a subject of much interest because of its cryptic lyrics which vary from region to region, and many theories exist about its meaning, but neither have been definitely explained.

Lyrics:

かごめかごめ 籠の中の鳥は
Kagome kagome / Kago no naka no tori wa

いついつ出やる　夜明けの晩に
Itsu itsu deyaru / Yoake no ban ni

鶴と亀が滑った
Tsuru to kame ga subetta.

後ろの正面だあれ
Ushiro no shoumen daare
