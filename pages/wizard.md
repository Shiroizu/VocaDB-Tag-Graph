#Themes

>A **magician**, also known as an **enchanter**/**enchantress**, **mage**, **magic-user**, **sorcerer/sorceress**, **spell-caster**, **warlock**, **witch**, or **wizard**, is someone who uses or practices magic derived from supernatural, occult, or arcane sources. 
Magicians are common figures in works of fantasy, such as fantasy literature and role-playing games, and enjoy a rich history in mythology, legends, fiction, and folklore.

>Wizards are often depicted as old, white-haired, and with long white beards majestic enough to occasionally host lurking woodland creatures.
This depiction predates the modern fantasy genre, being derived from the traditional image of wizards such as Merlin.
