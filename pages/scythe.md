>A scythe is an agricultural hand tool for mowing grass or harvesting crops.
It is historically used to cut down or reap edible grains, before the process of threshing.
The scythe has been largely replaced by horse-drawn and then tractor machinery, but is still used in some areas of Europe and Asia.
Reapers are bladed machines that automate the cutting of the scythe, and sometimes subsequent steps in preparing the grain or the straw or hay.

>A sickle, bagging hook, reaping-hook or grasshook is a single-handed agricultural tool designed with variously curved blades and typically used for harvesting, or reaping, grain crops or cutting succulent forage chiefly for feeding livestock, either freshly cut or dried as hay.
Falx was a synonym but was later used to mean any of a number of tools that had a curved blade that was sharp on the inside edge such as a scythe.
