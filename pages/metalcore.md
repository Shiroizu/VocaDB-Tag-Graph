#Genres

>Metalcore is a fusion genre combining elements of [extreme metal](https://vocadb.net/T/4943/extreme-metal) and [hardcore punk](https://vocadb.net/T/4874/hardcore-punk). 
As with other styles blending metal and hardcore, such as [crust punk](https://vocadb.net/T/4998/crust-punk) and [grindcore](https://vocadb.net/T/3439/grindcore), metalcore is noted for its use of breakdowns, slow, intense passages conducive to moshing. 
Other defining instrumental qualities include heavy riffs and stop-start rhythm guitar playing, occasional blast beats, and double bass drumming.
