#Copyrights

MILGRAM is an (out of scope) multimedia project primarily consisting of songs produced by [DECO*27](https://vocadb.net/Ar/45) and [Rockwell](https://vocadb.net/Ar/60068), all with animations done by [OTOIRO](https://vocadb.net/Ar/74679). All of the songs have free instrumentals in their descriptions.

The series consists of songs that reveal vague details about various murders, with the goal of having the viewers determine if the character in the song can be forgiven or not.
