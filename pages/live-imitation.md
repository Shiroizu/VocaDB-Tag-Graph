#Sources

For songs which have "live version" in the title (or in the description) but are actually not recorded live but were edited/manipulated to sound live e.g. audience screaming in the background, vocalist is talking to the audience etc.

- Note that just because the song says "live version" it doesn't automatically mean it was actually recorded live. For real live versions/recordings, the "[live-recording-tag](https://vocadb.net/T/240/live-recording)" should be used.
