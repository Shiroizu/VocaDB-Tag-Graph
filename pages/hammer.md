#Themes

>A tool, most often a hand tool, consisting of a weighted "head" fixed to a long handle that is swung to deliver an impact to a small area of an object.
This can be, for example, to drive nails into wood, to shape metal (as with a forge), or to crush rock.
Hammers are used for a wide range of driving, shaping, breaking and non-destructive striking applications.
Traditional disciplines include carpentry, blacksmithing, warfare, and percussive musicianship (as with a gong).
