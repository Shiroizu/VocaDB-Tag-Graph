#Instruments

A 12-string guitar is a guitar with 12 strings in six courses, producing a thicker, more ringing tone than a standard six-string guitar. Typically, the strings of the lower four courses are tuned in octaves, while those of the upper two courses are tuned in unison.

Examples of songs using a 12-string guitar include "Hotel California" by The Eagles, played on an acoustic 12-string, and "Ticket to Ride" by The Beatles, played on an electric 12-string.
