#Genres

"Gothic rock is a genre of rock music that emerged from post-punk. Typical aspects of the sound include darkest sound having inspirations in gothic literature, moderate-to-heavy employment of chorus or flanger, reverb, and delay effects."

EDITOR NOTES: this needs to be properly split from the "gothic rock" tag, since it's currently stuck describing two very different genres.
