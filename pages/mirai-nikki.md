#Copyrights

A Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Sakae Esuno. An anime adaptation was produced by Asread.

Lonely high school student, Yukiteru Amano, spends his days writing a diary on his cellphone, while conversing with his two seemingly imaginary friends Deus Ex Machina, who is the god of time and space, and Murmur, the god's servant. Revealing himself to be an actual entity, Deus grants Yukiteru a "Random Diary," which shows highly descriptive entries based on the future and forces him into a bloody battle royale with 11 other holders of similarly powerful future diaries ([MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/anime/10620/Mirai_Nikki_TV)).
