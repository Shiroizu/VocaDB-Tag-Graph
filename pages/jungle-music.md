#Genres

Jungle (sometimes oldschool jungle), is a genre of electronic music derived from breakbeat hardcore that developed in England in the early 1990s as part of rave music scenes. The style is characterized by rapid tempos (150 to 200 bpm) and breakbeats, as well as dub reggae-derived basslines, heavily syncopated percussive loops, samples and synthesized effects. Long pitch-shifted snare rolls are common in oldschool jungle. The terms "jungle" and "drum and bass" are often used interchangeably, though “jungle” has been used specifically to refer to the earlier iteration of the style. Jungle originated out of oldschool and in the late 1990's the term "drum and bass" was used in association with music that did not have the same emphasis on breakbeats and complex production. 
Producers create the drum patterns, which are sometimes completely off-beat, by cutting apart breakbeats (most notably the Amen break). Jungle producers incorporated classic Jamaican/Caribbean sound-system culture production-methods. The slow, deep basslines and simple melodies (reminiscent of those found in dub, reggae and dancehall) accentuated the overall production, giving jungle its "rolling" quality.
