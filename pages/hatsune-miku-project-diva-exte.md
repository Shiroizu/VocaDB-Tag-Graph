> Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Extend (初音ミク -Project DIVA- extend) is a 2011 rhythm game created by Sega and Crypton Future Media for the PlayStation Portable.
The game is an expansion to the 2010 video game, Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA 2nd, and was first released on November 10, 2011 in Japan with no international release.
Like the original the game primarily makes use of Vocaloids, a series of singing synthesizer software, and the songs created using these vocaloids most notably the virtual-diva Vocaloid Hatsune Miku.
Rock band Gacharic Spin served as motion capture models.

> Similar to Project DIVA and Project DIVA 2nd, a companion game for the PlayStation 3, Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Dreamy Theater Extend, was released digitally via the Japanese PlayStation Store on September 13, 2012.
Like its predecessors, the game features updated high-definition visual improvements over its respective PSP game while featuring the same content and PlayStation Trophies support, and requires the player to connect the PSP (with Project DIVA Extend) to the PS3 via USB to access the content in the game.
In addition, the game also supports stereoscopic 3D for the first time in the series.
