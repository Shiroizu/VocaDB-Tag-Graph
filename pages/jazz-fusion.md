#Genres

Jazz fusion, fusion, or jazz rock is a musical genre that developed in the late 1960s from mixing funk and rhythm and blues rhythms with the electric instruments, amplified sound, electronic effects and playing styles of rock music together with jazz's complex time signatures (which were derived from non-Western music) and jazz's complex chord progressions and altered and extended chords.
