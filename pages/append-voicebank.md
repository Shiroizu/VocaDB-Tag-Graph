#Vocalists

**"Append" voicebanks are newer banks designed to sound remarkably different from the original bank.** 

For instance, [IA ROCKS](https://vocadb.net/Ar/17035) emphasizes sharper, brighter sounds in comparison to the original [IA](https://vocadb.net/Ar/504) voicebank, making it an Append. *However*, pure upgrades—such as [Kaai Yuki V4](https://vocadb.net/Ar/28164)—are *not* Appends. Moreover, certain characters come equipped with both Appended banks and 'standard' banks, such as [GUMI V3](https://vocadb.net/Ar/1881). In her case, [GUMI V3 Native](https://vocadb.net/Ar/1881) is the pure upgrade, while [Adult](https://vocadb.net/Ar/268), [Whisper](https://vocadb.net/Ar/269), [Power](https://vocadb.net/Ar/270), and [Sweet](https://vocadb.net/Ar/271) are all Appends.

This tag is named after the first of [Crypton](https://vocadb.net/Ar/25)'s Append voicebanks—[Hatsune Miku Append](https://vocadb.net/Ar/343), [Kagamine Len Append](https://vocadb.net/Ar/354), & [Kagamine Rin Append](https://vocadb.net/Ar/353).
