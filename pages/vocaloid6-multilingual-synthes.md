#Vocalists

A feature of VOCALOID6 that allows AI voicebanks to read Japanese, English, and Chinese phonemes, regardless of what language the voicebank was recorded in.

Note that voicebanks should still be tagged with the languages they were recorded for, instead of the languages this feature allows.
