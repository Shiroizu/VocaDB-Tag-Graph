> _Kojiki_ (_"Records of Ancient Matters"_ or _"An Account of Ancient Matters"_), also sometimes read as _Furukotofumi_ or _Furukotobumi_, is an early Japanese chronicle of myths, legends, hymns, genealogies, oral traditions, and semi-historical accounts down to 641 concerning the origin of the Japanese archipelago, the kami (神), and the Japanese imperial line. It is claimed in its preface to have been composed by Ō no Yasumaro at the request of Empress Genmei in the early 8th century (711–712), and thus is usually considered to be the oldest extant literary work in Japan.
