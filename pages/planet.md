#Themes

- A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity and is not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion.

- A dwarf planet is a planetary-mass object that does not dominate its region of space and is not a satellite. It is in direct orbit of the Sun.
