>Pisces (♓︎/♓) is the twelfth and final astrological sign in the zodiac.
It is a negative, mutable sign. It spans 330° to 360° of celestial longitude.
Under the tropical zodiac, the sun transits this area between February 19 and March 20.
In classical interpretations, the symbol of the fish is derived from the ichthyocentaurs, who aided Aphrodite when she was born from the sea.
According to some tropical astrologers, the current astrological age is the Age of Pisces, while others maintain that currently it is the Age of Aquarius.
