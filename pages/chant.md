#Vocalists

For songs that have at least one fragment that can be described as _chanting_:
- a repeated rhythmic phrase, typically one shouted or sung in unison by a crowd;
- a short musical passage in two or more phrases used for singing unmetrical words; a psalm or canticle sung to such music.

Also for albums that contain songs to which the above condition applies.

> A chant (from French _chanter_, from Latin _cantare_, "to sing") is the iterative speaking or singing of words or sounds, often primarily on one or two main pitches called reciting tones. Chants may range from a simple melody involving a limited set of notes to highly complex musical structures, often including a great deal of repetition of musical subphrases, such as Great Responsories and Offertories of Gregorian chant. Chant may be considered speech, music, or a heightened or stylized form of speech. In the later Middle Ages some religious chant evolved into song (forming one of the roots of later Western music).
