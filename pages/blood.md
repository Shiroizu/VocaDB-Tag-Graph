#Themes

This tag usually applies to songs or albums featuring character(s) that are bleeding, or where blood is otherwise shown in the PV, but can also be used for when the subject matter is blood itself. Often, but not necessarily, used in conjunction with tags like [murder](https://vocadb.net/T/2832/kill), [guro](https://vocadb.net/T/2971/guro), and similar tags.
