#Vocalists

AITalk is a speech synthesis engine created by [AI, Inc.](https://vocadb.net/Ar/77017) that originally released on [July 10th, 2007](https://web.archive.org/web/20071128075734/https://www.ai-j.jp/).
Though the engine has been used as the basis for several programs, none are cross-compatible with each other and thus each bank can only be used within their respective version. According to the [Vocal Synthesizer Wiki](https://vocalsynth.fandom.com/wiki/AITalk), "it has been used as the base for VOICEROID, galaco Talk, Otomachi Una Talk EX, Gynoid Talk, and A.I.VOICE."

**This is a tag for voicebanks that directly utilize AITalk itself; for voicebanks attached to child programs, please use their respective tags instead.**
