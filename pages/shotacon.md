#Themes

A Japanese slang describing an attraction to young boys.

It refers to a genre of manga and anime wherein pre-pubescent or pubescent male characters are depicted in a suggestive or erotic manner, whether in the obvious role of object of attraction, or the less apparent role of "subject" (the character the reader is designed to associate with). In some stories, the young male character is paired with a male, usually in a homoerotic manner. In others, he is paired with a female, which the general community would call straight shota. -Wikipedia

Use on artist entries is restricted to voicebanks only, and only if it's an official label.
