#Series

From [The Evillious Chronicles Wiki](https://theevilliouschronicles.fandom.com/wiki/Clockwork_Lullaby_Series):
>The Clockwork Lullaby Series is a series of Vocaloid songs conceptualized and developed by Akuno-P. It belongs to mothy's larger Evillious Chronicles. Including some of his earliest songs, it is one of the music producer's oldest series and has since developed as a bridge between mothy's other series as well as elaborating upon the later events in his story. Like its name, it is recognized for incorporating the "Clockwork Lullaby" into each song.
