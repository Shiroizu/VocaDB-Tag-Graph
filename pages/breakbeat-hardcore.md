#Genres

Breakbeat hardcore (aka old skool rave hardcore) is a form of acid house/techno combined with breakbeats that originated in the UK rave scene in early 1990s. Basically breakbeat hardcore that focused on  piano sections (usually Korg M1), the rave stabs, synth patterns common to acid house/techno and sometimes high-pitched vocals, include hook/riff samples from classic house/techno tracks of the late 1980s and early 1990s. It's usually strong 4-to-the-floor beat with a tempo range of 110â€“150 BPM.

Note: not to be confused with breakcore as a fast-paced genre of drum and bass.
