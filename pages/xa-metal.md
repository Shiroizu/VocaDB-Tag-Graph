#Genres

_XaMetal_ is a term coined by the moderator of _Moon Madness_. It is vaguely characterized as "having (excessively) "smelly" melody and unpolished sound". It is pronounced as "kusa-metal" [from _kusai_: stinking, smelly, clumzy]. _([xametal.net](http://www.xametal.net/))_

_XaMetal_, _Xa-Metal_ or sometimes _Febreze Metal_ (from the Febreze deodorant -- referring to the "smelliness") is a name given to heavy metal music that has an overly exaggerated composition or induces an intense feeling of melancholy (note that if only the lyrics are "smelly", it is not considered _XaMetal_). It emerged after bands such as _Sonata Arctica_, _Children of Bodom_ and _Rhapsody of Fire_'s raise to popularity as many young metal bands adopted their style in their own way; _XaMetal_ refers to some bands taking it to extremes or "overdoing" it. Since there is a number of listeners who specifically prefer this kind of sound, it is, in a sense, recognized as a musical genre. _([NicoNicoPedia](https://dic.nicovideo.jp/id/202656))_
