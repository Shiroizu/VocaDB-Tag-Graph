**Not to be confused with [loli](https://vocadb.net/T/242/loli) or [lolicon](https://vocadb.net/T/2757/lolicon).**

>A fashion subculture from Japan that is highly influenced by Victorian and Edwardian children's clothing and styles from the Rococo period. Main feature of Lolita fashion is the volume of the skirt, a doll-like look often created by wearing a petticoat or crinoline in combination with headwear such as hair bows or a bonnet.
A very distinctive property of Lolita fashion is the aesthetic of cuteness.
This clothing subculture can be categorized into three main substyles: 'gothic', 'classic', and 'sweet'. Many other substyles such as 'sailor', 'country', 'hime' (princess), 'ero', 'guro', 'oriental', 'punk', 'shiro (white)', kuro (black) and steampunk lolita also exist. This style evolved into a widely followed subculture in Japan and other countries in the 1990s and 2000s and may have waned in Japan as of the 2010s as the fashion became more mainstream.
