#Sources

A Japanese image-sharing service that partnered with Nico Nico Douga during the site's beta phase. From February 19, 2007 to May 28, 2008, PhotoZou users could upload videos to Nico Nico Douga by proxy, with their videos including the prefix "fz" instead of "sm". This was formerly a common way of uploading videos, but usage of this feature became rare after direct uploading was introduced.

On September 30, 2011, all PhotoZou videos were deleted. Due to the service's obscurity, it is relatively difficult to find archived information on its videos.

Applicable to:
- Songs uploaded through PhotoZou;
- artists that often use PhotoZou for their songs.
