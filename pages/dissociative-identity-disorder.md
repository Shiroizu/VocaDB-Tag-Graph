#Themes

Songs and albums in which the character(s) has dissociative identity disorder. Often linked with [abuse](https://vocadb.net/T/2822/abuse) and [depression](https://vocadb.net/T/4573/depression), as dissociative identities commonly develop through trauma. It may also overlap with the [multiple persona](https://vocadb.net/T/6753/multiple-persona) tag.

Also applies to artists who make songs about DID and to vocalists who canonically have DID.
