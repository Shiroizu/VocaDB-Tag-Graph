#Animation

A visual art related to writing. It is the design and execution of lettering with a pen, ink brush, or other writing instrument.
- Modern calligraphy ranges from functional inscriptions and designs to fine-art pieces where the letters may or may not be readable.
- Classical calligraphy differs from typography and non-classical hand-lettering, though a calligrapher may practice both.
