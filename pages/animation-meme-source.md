#Editor_notes

This tag tracks songs where a part of the song's PV has become an animation meme. Note that covers with new PVs do not fall under this tag's scope.
 
Animation memes, in VocaDB's scope, are widespread animations that typically begin after one animator makes an animation featuring a certain "catchy" part of a song, usually with characters dancing (sometimes singing). These then go on to be parodied by other animators, who reanimate the original and replace the characters with different ones.

These videos also tend to go by other names than the original. 

Common examples of this tag:
* Tenrenry's "[Uminaoshi Meme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNw2vfFfcQE&pp=ygUOdW1pbmFvc2hpIG1lbWU%3D)", uses [Uminaoshi](https://vocadb.net/S/166095) by [MARETU](https://vocadb.net/Ar/1665). *(The Thumbnail)*
* [Amygdala's Rag Doll](https://vocadb.net/S/137139) by [GHOST](https://vocadb.net/Ar/26895) was parodied by animation memes, typically under the name "Trypophobia Meme".
* Another example is the song [Shinitai-chan](https://vocadb.net/S/57096) by [Switch](https://vocadb.net/Ar/5504), which goes often used not by the original, but an [English cover by JubyPhonic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucsadKDNTQA).
