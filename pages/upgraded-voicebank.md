#Sources

Covers where the song is remade using a newer ("upgraded") version of the same voice. This implies that an earlier version using an older voicebank exists.

For example, the original song is made using [Hatsune Miku V2](https://vocadb.net/Ar/1) while the cover uses the newer [Miku V3](https://vocadb.net/Ar/11839). This can also include the usage of a newer [Append voicebank](https://vocadb.net/T/24/append-or-equivalent); in the case of the above example, the new cover uses [Miku V3 Dark](https://vocadb.net/Ar/11835). This can even apply to covers using newer voicebanks in a different program from the original; to continue with the earlier analogy, if an original song used Miku from Vocaloid 2 and a cover used [Miku NT](https://vocadb.net/Ar/84429), then it counts for this tag.

This also applies to albums where multiple songs have been upgraded.
