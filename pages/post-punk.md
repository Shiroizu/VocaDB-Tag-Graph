#Genres

>Post-punk is a broad genre of rock music that emerged in the late 1970s as musicians departed from the raw simplicity and traditionalism of punk rock, instead adopting a variety of avant-garde sensibilities and non-rock influences. Inspired by punk's energy and DIY ethic but determined to break from rock cliches, artists experimented with styles like funk, electronic music, jazz, and dance music; the production techniques of dub and disco; and ideas from art and politics, including critical theory, modernist art, cinema and literature.
--from Wikipedia

Post-punk is typically features a pulsating sound and rhythm section of bass and drums. The bass sound in post-punk is often play bass guitar with a pick, apply a little overdrive and the mid frequency emphasized, or using chorus effect pedal and plays in the upper positions of the bass neck. The guitar usually plays with punk riffs and jangly guitar riffs, sometimes including significant use of chorus, phaser and reverb effects.
