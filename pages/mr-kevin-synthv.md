#Animation

A joke design of [Synthesizer V AI Kevin](https://vocadb.net/Ar/99147) by [ivylare](https://vocadb.net/Ar/75116) depicting him as a [stickman](https://vocadb.net/T/8750/stickman) gamer with a [Zelda Triforce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triforce) shirt and cargo shorts. Despite being a joke (or perhaps because of it), it's likely Kevin's most popular, widespread [fan design](https://vocadb.net/T/9020/mascot-less-voicebank), having [even appeared](https://twitter.com/Mipeba1/status/1589055138811236352) in [MIKU EXPO Digital Stars](https://vocadb.net/E/4670/miku-expo-rewind-digital-stars).
