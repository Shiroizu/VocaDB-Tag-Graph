#Genres

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubstep#Post-dubstep):
>In early 2011, the term "post-dubstep" (sometimes known as bass music) was used to describe urban music that was influenced by certain aspects of dubstep. Such music often references earlier dubstep productions as well as UK garage, 2-step and other forms of underground electronic dance music. Artists producing music described as post-dubstep have also incorporated elements of ambient music and early R&B. The tempo of music typically characterised as post-dubstep is approximately 130 beats per minute.
