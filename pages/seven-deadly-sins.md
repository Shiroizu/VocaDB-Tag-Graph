From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_deadly_sins):
>The seven deadly sins, also known as the capital vices or cardinal sins, is a grouping and classification of vices within Christian teachings. Behaviours or habits are classified under this category if they directly give birth to other immoralities. According to the standard list, they are pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath and sloth, which are also contrary to the seven virtues. These sins are often thought to be abuses or excessive versions of one's natural faculties or passions (for example, gluttony abuses one's desire to eat).

Note: While it is related to [mothy's series](https://vocadb.net/T/7013/seven-deadly-sins-series), this tag covers the concept of the seven deadly sins in general and is not specific to a series, nor songs created by mothy.
