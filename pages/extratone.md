#Genres

>Songs with a BPM of 3,600 or higher are known as Extratone songs.
At this tempo, the kicks happen so fast that the individual kicks or beats cannot be distinguished from one another, making the beat sound like one constant note with a pitch.
Extratone originates from combining the two German words, extrahieren (to extract) and Ton (sound), which was coined by Einrich 3600.
