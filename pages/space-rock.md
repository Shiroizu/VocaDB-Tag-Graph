#Genres

>Space rock is a subgenre of rock music that typically features lengthy, hypnotic sonic explorations and loose song structures. Artists may make use of slow, otherworldly instrumentation, effects-laden textures, and languid vocals, and may draw influence from drug use as well as from musical styles such as psychedelic rock, ambient music, the avant-garde, krautrock, and minimalism
