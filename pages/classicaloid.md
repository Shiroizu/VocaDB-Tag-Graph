ClassicaLoid (クラシカロイド) is a 2016 Japanese comedy anime television series produced by Sunrise and NHK. The series premiered on October 8, 2016, on NHK E. A second season started airing on October 7, 2017.

Two high school students, Kanae Otowa and Sōsuke Kagura, live in a rural town that is attempting to reinvigorate their town with music. Otowa and Kagura notice one day that ClassicaLoids of Beethoven and Mozart have appeared. The two ClassicaLoids play music they refer to as "Musik", which Otowa and Kagura soon discover is a power that causes stars to fall and giant robots to appear, turning every day henceforth bewildered. Subsequently, ClassicaLoids of Chopin, Bach, Schubert and other renowned composers also start to appear. The power that the ClassicaLoids hold and their origin remains a mystery that is yet to be discovered.
