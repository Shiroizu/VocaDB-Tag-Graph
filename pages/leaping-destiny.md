Leaping Destiny is a 3D rhythm game for smartphones developed by DWARF PLANET Inc. The game was released on May 24th, 2019. 

A collaboration with [Otomachi Una (音街ウナ)](https://vocadb.net/Ar/49701) started on July 30th, 2020, the collaboration featured Otomachi Una as a playable character and the original song [Go my way! (ごーまいうぇい！)](https://vocadb.net/S/289197?albumId=28712) by [kinoshita (キノシタ)](https://vocadb.net/Ar/49740). Since then, Una was made a permanent character in the game and several Una songs have been added later, all picked from the annual Otomachi Una song contests.
