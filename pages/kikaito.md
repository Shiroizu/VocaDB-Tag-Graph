#Derivative

Kikaito is a yellow themed derivative of the official Vocaloid Kaito. His name is a combination of "Kaito" and "Ki", which means 'yellow' in Japanese. But it can also be a combination of "Kaito" and "Kikai" which means 'machine' in Japanese.

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
