>From an alternate timeline and branch of the 'multiverse', Andy Linh, known by his stage name  “ANDI” is a 22 year old rapper, singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist. Known for his hypnotic vocals and subversive fashion style that departs from industry norms, ANDI first began streaming his music on SoundCloud in late 2017 while still in high school and garnered attention from multiple record producers. That year, he also signed to a label after being scouted by a multi-platinum record producer and collaborated on a mixtape with him as his protégé. In 2023, after a long hiatus from music and parting ways with his former management, ANDI signed onto AO Music and reprised his role as a singer-songwriter. Once more, ANDI is ready to step in front of the mic and rile up the world with his performance.
