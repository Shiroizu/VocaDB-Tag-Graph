>"**Resurrection** or **anastasis** is the concept of coming back to life after death.
In a number of religions, a dying-and-rising god is a deity which dies and is **resurrected**.
**Reincarnation** is a similar process hypothesized by other religions, which involves the same person or deity coming back to live in a different body, rather than the same one."
-Wikipedia

>"General **resurrection** or universal **resurrection** is the belief in a **resurrection** of the dead, or **resurrection** from the dead by which most or all people who have died would be **resurrected** (brought back to life).
Various forms of this concept can be found in Christian, Islamic, Jewish, Samaritanism and Zoroastrian eschatology."
