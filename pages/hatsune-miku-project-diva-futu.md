> On September 15, 2015, during the SCEJA Press Conference at Tokyo Game Show 2015, Sega announced that the company was porting Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Arcade Future Tone to the PlayStation 4 under the title Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Future Tone.
On May 27, 2016, a trailer for the game was released on the franchise's official YouTube channel, where it was revealed that the game would include two expansion packs available to download separately or together via the PlayStation Store; Future Sound and Colorful Tone.
Future Sound contains songs originally featured in the mainstream Project DIVA games, while Colorful Tone contains songs originally featured in Project DIVA Arcade (some not included due to rights issues) and the Project Mirai games, as well as over 340 unlockable modules.
A base demo software version of the game, Prelude, was also made available.
In addition, the game supports a screen resolution of up to 4K at a refresh rate of 60 frames per second.

> The game was released digitally on June 23, 2016 in Japan, with an international release following on January 10, 2017.
