#Genres

Grunge is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged in the mid-1980s in Seattle, Washington. It fuses elements of punk rock and heavy metal, commonly utilizes distorted guitar effects like fuzz (usually the Big Muff), frequently employs drop tuning (commonly drop D) as well as E flat or E standard tuning, and often features dynamic shifts that go from quiet to loud (as seen in Nirvana's music). Lyrics are typically angst-filled, frustrated, depressed, and fearful.
