#Games

Reflec Beat (stylised as REFLEC BEAT and occasionally shortened to Rb) is a series of music video games by Konami which debuted in 2010. Reflec Beat uses a touch screen as its main method of control - the first in the Bemani series to do so - and has gameplay based on 2-player competition, which has been compared to air hockey.

Originally released for arcades, six versions, not including expanded update versions, have been released. The gameplay has been ported to iOS as REFLEC BEAT plus, which has in turn been localised and released worldwide as REFLEC BEAT +.
