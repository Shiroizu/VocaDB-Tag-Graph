#Vocalists

Sinsy is an Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Deep Neural Net (DNN) singing synthesis program created by the [Nagoya Institute of Technology](https://vocadb.net/Ar/117172). It is unique in that it is completely hosted online and is platform-independent. A source code for an older version of Sinsy is available under a free license, but it only supports Japanese and has [only one voice](https://vocadb.net/Ar/44703). It can also be used as a frontend to [NNSVS](https://vocadb.net/T/7693/nnsvs).
