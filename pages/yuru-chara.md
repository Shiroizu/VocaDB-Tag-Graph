#Themes

>A Japanese term for a category of mascot characters; usually created to promote a place or region, event, organisation or business.
They are characterized by their kawaii (cute) and unsophisticated designs, often incorporating motifs that represent local culture, history or produce.
They may be created by local government or other organizations to stimulate tourism and economic development, or created by a company to build on their corporate identity.
They may appear as costumed characters (or kigurumi) at promotional events and festivals.
Yuru-chara has become a popular and lucrative business, with character-driven sales reaching nearly $16 billion in Japan in 2012.
Popular yuru-chara include Kumamon, Funassyi, and Chiitan, who have gained international recognition and have reached celebrity status in Japan.
