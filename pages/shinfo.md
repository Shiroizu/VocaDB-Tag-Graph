#Derivative

**Shinfo**, shortened for **Shinfoni**, is a FANLOID created by LimeSoda-P. Her voice is [Aoki Lapis](https://vocadb.net/Ar/156).

She was created out of boredom and is a beginner FANLOID trying to get as famous as Usagi no Oto and Tanaka Riko.

According to the Fanloid wiki, Shinfo's colours are based on KAITO's, but are much lighter. Her concept is a mixture of Miku, Rin, Len and Luka, as well as 90's disco.
