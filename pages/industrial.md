#Genres

>Harsh, experimental electronic music. Industrial music emerged in the 1970s and stems from the idea of music created for a new generation, with previous music being more "agricultural". Even though artists preferred electronic equipment, traditional instruments were sometimes still used, but usually in nontraditional ways. Industrial artists will often pick difficult or taboo themes that will reflect both musically and visually in their output. (from Discogs)
