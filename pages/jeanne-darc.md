> Joan of Arc is a patron saint of France, honored as a defender of the French nation for her role in the siege of Orléans and her insistence on the coronation of Charles VII of France during the Hundred Years' War.
Claiming to be acting under divine guidance, she became a military leader who transcended gender roles and gained recognition as a savior of France.
