From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori):
>In Japan, hikikomori are reclusive adolescents or adults who withdraw from social life, often seeking extreme degrees of isolation and confinement. Hikikomori refers to both the phenomenon in general and the recluses themselves. Hikikomori have been described as loners or "modern-day hermits".
