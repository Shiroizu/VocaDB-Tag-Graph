#Editor_notes

For entries with uncredited art by someone other than the main producer (composer).

If the source (human illustrator) is found, it should be added to the entry as a normal artist credit. The source should be mentioned or clarified in the edit notes, description or in the comment section. After adding the missing credit to the entry, this **tag can be removed.**

If the art used is official art, refer to [official art PV](https://vocadb.net/T/6495/official-art-pv).

**This tag is redundant for entries using [AI generated art](https://vocadb.net/T/9119/ai-generated-art).**
