> Pluggnb emerged from the Plugg production sphere in the late 2010s in the works of XanGang and Goyxrd. Contrasting with the earlier straightforward and laid-back sound of MexikoDro's plugg, pluggnb emphasizes more melodic, intricate, and layered leads, and typically more complex and dense drum programming.
