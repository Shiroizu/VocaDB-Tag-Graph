#Genres

From Wikipedia:
>Noise rock (sometimes called noise punk) is a diverse style of experimental rock that spun off from punk rock in the 1980s. Drawing from no wave, minimalism, industrial music, and New York hardcore, artists indulge in extreme levels of distortion through the use of electric guitars, and less frequently, electronic instrumentation, either to provide percussive sounds or to contribute to the overall arrangement.
