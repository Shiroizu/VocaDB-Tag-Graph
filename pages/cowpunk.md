#Genres

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowpunk):
>Cowpunk (or country punk) is a subgenre of punk rock that began in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s and California in the early 1980s.  It combines punk rock or new wave with country, folk and blues in sound, subject matter, attitude, and style.  Many of the musicians in this scene have now become associated with alternative country or roots rock.
