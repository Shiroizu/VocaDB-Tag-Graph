> _Origami_ is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with Japanese culture. In modern usage, the word "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their culture of origin. (Wikipedia)

This tag can be used for both videos made out of origami, and videos/albums that use origami heavily within them (whether or not the origami is physical or drawn).
