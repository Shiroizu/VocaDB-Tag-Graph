#Vocalists

The middle **female** voice typically between A3 and A5.

___

>A **mezzo-soprano** or **mezzo** is a type of classical **female** singing voice whose vocal range lies between the **soprano** and the **contralto** voice types.
The **mezzo-soprano's** vocal range usually extends from the A below middle C to the A two octaves above (i.e. A3–A5 in scientific pitch notation, where middle C = C4; 220–880 Hz).
In the lower and upper extremes, some **mezzo-sopranos** may extend down to the F below middle C (F3, 175 Hz) and as high as "high C" (C6, 1047 Hz).
The **mezzo-soprano** voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, lyric, and dramatic.
