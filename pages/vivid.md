**This is a theme color tag! These tags are meant to denote videos or characters with a distinctive focal color, or songs *about* said color. Not everything needs to be tagged with these.**

Neon (named after the gas used within a certain type of ultra-vibrant light) or vivid colours are those where the hue and *especially* the saturation have been maximized. A neon or vivid aesthetic is built upon these searingly bright colours, sometimes in tandem with neutrals (especially black).

This tag may be used for:
* characters that utilize a neon palette in their official art
* songs, videos, and albums that utilize a neon palette
* artists who frequently work within a neon palette

[Art](https://piapro.jp/t/o5cz) by [Jagabata](https://vocadb.net/Ar/56352). It depicts a highly saturated [v4 flower](https://vocadb.net/Ar/34480) against vibrant blue and red wires and an equally vibrant purple background. Note the usage of a neutral tone (in this case: white) to help the neon tones stand out in comparison.
