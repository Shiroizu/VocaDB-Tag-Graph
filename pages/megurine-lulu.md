A derivative of [Luka Megurine](https://vocadb.net/Ar/2), Lulu is her (fanmade) younger sister and has a higher voice than her counterpart. She was originally created by Hankyou (Rena-tan) in January 2009.

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have an own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank e.g. Hatsune Miku.
