#Genres

Goregrind deviates from typical Grindcore in three aspects: the persistent use of very low pitch shifted vocals; the willingness to employ more mid-tempo rhythms rather than rampant full throttle speed; and an almost exclusive lyrical obsession with medical terminology, pathological conditions, and violence upon the human body. These themes are chosen largely for shock value, and are often conveyed in a purposely over-the-top fashion. In return, some see this as the predecessor to Deathgrind.
