#Animation

"Traditional" illustrations are **those done predominantly non-digitally, A.K.A. "by hand".** This could be through **painting watercolours, acrylics, oil, spray painting, penciling, charcoal, crayons, or any other type of non-digital** tool. For instance, [namira's](https://vocadb.net/Ar/99083) artwork of [Lily](https://vocadb.net/Ar/139) uses pencil crayons, as seen most clearly in the colour and lighting techniques.
