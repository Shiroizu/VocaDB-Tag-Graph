#Sources

Short versions of songs. These can be either original songs or remixes/remasters.
Only use this tag for songs by the **original artist/producer**.
If possible, add the "extended version" tag to the "counterpart" song entry.

Unlike partial version, the short version should still be a complete song. For song entries of type "Music PV", this requirement may be relaxed.

___

>In music, a radio edit or radio mix is a modification, typically truncated or censored, intended to make a song more suitable for airplay, whether it be adjusted for length, profanity, subject matter, instrumentation, or form.
Radio edits may also be used for commercial single versions, which may be denoted as the 7" version, as opposed to the 12" version which are extended versions of a song.
Not all "radio edit" tracks are played on radio.
