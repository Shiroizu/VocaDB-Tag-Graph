#Genres

Bubblegum bass (sometimes called PC music, bubblebass, post-ringtone) is a new style of electronic and pop music which amplifies cuteness, femininity and deliriousness to extreme levels, often pitching the vocals upward and warping the rhythm through a frenzied bass and wonky filter. The production uses bouncy, plastic-sounding synths and further draws from a variety of club sounds, including eurodance, house, trance, grime, footwork and R&B.

Bubblegum bass takes a lot of inspiration from nightcore, causing some overlap between it and nxc. K-pop as well as J-pop have also been cited as influences.
