___

> Hatsune Miku and Future Stars: Project Mirai (初音ミク and Future Stars Project mirai) is a 2012 rhythm game created by Sega and Crypton Future Media for the Nintendo 3DS.
The game is a spin-off of the Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA series of Vocaloid rhythm games and was first released on March 8, 2012 in Japan with no international release.
Like the original, the game primarily makes use of Vocaloids, a series of singing synthesizer softwares, and the songs created using them, most notably the virtual-diva Vocaloid Hatsune Miku.
It is also the first game in the franchise to include a Vocaloid made by Internet Co., Ltd.; the mascot of Megpoid, Gumi, appears as a guest star.

> On July 2, 2014, it was announced that a new version of the game, titled Hatsune Miku: Project Mirai DX, was in development for a 2015 release.
On September 8, 2015, the game was released in North America.

> A sequel to the game, titled Hatsune Miku: Project Mirai 2, was released in Japan on November 28, 2013.
