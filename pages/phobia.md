Umbrella term for all kinds of phobias, excluding social phobias ([Anxiety disorder](https://vocadb.net/T/7839/anxiety-disorder) and [Agoraphobia](https://vocadb.net/T/7839/anxiety-disorder)).
___
A phobia is an excessive and irrational fear reaction.

Most phobias are classified into three categories:

- **Specific phobia**: Fear of particular objects or social situations that immediately results in anxiety and can sometimes lead to panic attacks.
It may be further subdivided into five categories:
-> **Animal type** – Fear of spiders, insects, dogs
-> **Natural environment type** – Fear of water (**aquaphobia**), heights (**acrophobia**), lightning and thunderstorms (**astraphobia**), or aging (**gerascophobia**).
-> **Situational type** – Fear of small confined spaces (**claustrophobia**), or the dark (**nyctophobia**).
-> **Blood/injection/injury type** – this includes fear of medical procedures, including needles and injections (**trypanophobia**), fear of blood (**hemophobia**) and fear of getting injured.
-> **Other** – children's fears of loud sounds or costumed characters.

- **[Agoraphobia](https://vocadb.net/T/7839/anxiety-disorder)**: a generalized fear of leaving home or a small familiar 'safe' area, and of possible panic attacks that might follow. It may also be caused by various specific phobias such as fear of open spaces, social embarrassment (**[social agoraphobia](https://vocadb.net/T/7839/anxiety-disorder)**), fear of contamination (fear of germs, possibly complicated by [obsessive-compulsive disorder](https://vocadb.net/T/7837/obsessivecompulsive-disorder)) or [PTSD](https://vocadb.net/T/7838/post-traumatic-stress-disorder) ([post traumatic stress disorder](https://vocadb.net/T/7838/post-traumatic-stress-disorder)) related to a trauma that occurred out of doors.

- **[Social phobia](https://vocadb.net/T/7839/anxiety-disorder)**, also known as [social anxiety disorder](https://vocadb.net/T/7839/anxiety-disorder), is when the situation is feared as the person is worried about others judging them.
