#Instruments

This tag applies to the brass instrument. For other types of horns, such as an [air horn](https://vocadb.net/T/6781), use that tag instead.

The horn is a brass instrument with coiled tubing and a flared bell. It's a direct descendant of the hunting horn from ancient times and has a characteristic majestic sound, yet can play soft enough to blend with the woodwind instruments. It's a regular member featured in various orchestras and concert bands.

Standard modern French horns are pitched in F and play a fifth lower than the written pitch. It has a derivative, the mellophone, which is used in marching bands.
