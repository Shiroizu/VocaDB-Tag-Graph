#Genres

Grindcore incorporates elements from Thrash Metal and Thrashcore and raised them to new levels of extremity and aggression. A lightning fast tempo of distorted chromatic guitar riffs played over relentless blast beats accompany vocals that consist mainly of unintelligible shrieks, growls, and barks. Grindcore songs typically attack in short, ultra-violent blasts of noise, in some cases lasting only a matter of seconds, with no readily apparent song structures. Grindcore bands attempts to represent the nihilism and decay that they sense in society through this extreme music, and angry lyrics that commonly speak of social and political issues.

Modern grindcore has expanded to include influences from Industrial Metal, Death Metal, and Noise.
