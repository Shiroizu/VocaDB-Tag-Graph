#Derivative

A derivative of [DarkGio Kiseki](https://vocadb.net/Ar/143761). Her voice can be achieved by setting a g-18 flag on Kiseki's voicebank.

Disclaimer:
Derivatives are NOT supposed to be a voicebank. They do NOT have their own voice. There is only a regular/popular way to tune them from an original voicebank (e.g. Hatsune Miku).
