#Instruments

"Strings", or "string quartet", is a classical European designation for this group of bowed stringed instruments: violin, viola, cello and double bass. A string quartet can form on its own, or it can pair with other instruments and even be in an orchestra.

The illustration is by [二枚貝](https://piapro.jp/clumselly).
