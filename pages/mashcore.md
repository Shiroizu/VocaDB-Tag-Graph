#Genres

Mashcore is a subgenre of Breakcore that first began to appear in the late 2000s and early 2010s. Mashcore heavily focuses on sampling, particularly from Pop and Electronic Dance Music songs, as well as playful melodies, hard kicks, and the typical breakcore-style breakbeats. The genre commonly has a Hardcore [EDM] influence, with four-on-the-floor Gabber style kicks, and is typically sillier and more upbeat than most other breakcore styles.
