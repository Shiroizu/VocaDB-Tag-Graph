>According to ancient and medieval science, **aether**, also known as the **fifth element** or **quintessence**, is the material that fills the region of the universe beyond the terrestrial sphere.
The concept of aether was used in several theories to explain several natural phenomena, such as the traveling of light and gravity.
In the late 19th century, physicists postulated that aether permeated all throughout space, providing a medium through which light could travel in a vacuum, but evidence for the presence of such a medium was not found in the Michelson–Morley experiment, and this result has been interpreted as meaning that no such luminiferous aether exists.

>**Japan (Godai):**
Void or Sky/Heaven represented things not of our everyday life.
