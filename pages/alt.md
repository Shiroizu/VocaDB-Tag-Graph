#Animation

ALT is a character from the [pop'n music](https://vocadb.net/T/9329/popn-music) video game series. She uses [Sarah](https://vocadb.net/Ar/73841), a voicebank from the program VocalWriter, to voice her.

This tag should be added to an entry if said entry either:
* Refers to Sarah as "ALT"; this is especially important for any [BEMANI](https://vocadb.net/T/9330) song or album

* Uses ALT's design or character to represent Sarah
