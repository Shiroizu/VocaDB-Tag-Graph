#Instruments

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizzicato):

>Pizzicato is a playing technique that involves plucking the strings of a string instrument. On bowed string instruments it is a method of playing by plucking the strings with the fingers, rather than using the bow. This produces a very different sound from bowing, short and percussive rather than sustained.

(this tag is meant for Pizzicato on bowed strings)
