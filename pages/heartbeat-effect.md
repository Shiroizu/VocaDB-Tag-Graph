#Instruments

This tag is for songs that utilize heartbeat sound effects. They are commonly heard in [medical-](https://vocadb.net/T/7244/medical) or [horror](https://vocadb.net/T/195/horror)-themed works, as they're used to indicate either a heart monitor or fear respectively. Less frequently, they can be found in simple [love](https://vocadb.net/T/1569/love) songs, representing the anxiety of a newfound crush or the like.
