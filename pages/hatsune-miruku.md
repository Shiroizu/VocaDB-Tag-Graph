#MMD_Models

Hatsune Milk (Hatsune Miku + Milk) is an MMD model created by [ポッジーニ(Pogini)](https://vocadb.net/Ar/15891) and first appeared in the song [ぐるぐる](https://vocadb.net/S/247886)

Hatsune Milk is clearly inspired by the VOCALOID2 character Hatsune Miku, but with the appearance of a milk carton with arms and legs and on the side with the "初音ミルク (Hatsune Milk)" logo.

Hatsune Milk has appeared in almost all of Pogini's songs as a background character, has also appeared in the producer's other MMD videos and has appeared in other songs such as [スケベニンゲン](https://vocadb.net/S/5200) by [PinocchioP](https://vocadb.net/Ar/28)
