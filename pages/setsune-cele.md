#Derivative

Setsune Cele is a derivative of Megurine Luka that was created by AoikamiP. She is usually represented through the use of Masisi's Luka model for MMD with its colors swapped for a cooler palette. Her voice is a softer and slightly higher pitched version of Luka's with GEN set to 40.

According to AoikamiP's works, Cele is a digital lifeform that was once a part of Luka before they were separated. She has had off and on feuds with Luka, but they have since reconciled. Cele's consciousness was put in a body resembling Luka's albeit with more combat capabilities. She now fights and destroys digital viruses and harmful programs in a "digital world".
