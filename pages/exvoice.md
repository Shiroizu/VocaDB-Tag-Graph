#Vocalists

exVoice is a set of WAV file packs containing miscellaneous sounds and noises. While it was originally bundled with [VOCALOID](https://vocadb.net/T/4857) and [VOICEROID](https://vocadb.net/T/486/voiceroid) banks, it later became attached to [many](https://vocadb.net/T/7776/aivoice) [other](https://vocadb.net/T/2838/cevio) [programs](https://vocadb.net/T/6745/synthesizer-v), or even as a standalone product of its own. On [September 23rd, 2021](https://twitter.com/VOCALOMAKETS/status/1441283259317440515), VOCALOMAKETS opened up the exVoice license for use for anyone who contacted them about it, and on [June 9th, 2022](https://twitter.com/VOCALOMAKETS/status/1534889840625713152), the license became usable by everyone, regardless of prior contact.

This tag may be added to:
* voicebanks that come with an attached exVoice sample pack, or base banks with a free-standing exVoice pack
* songs that utilize the exVoice sample packs
* albums that contain the aforementioned songs

**If exVoice samples of a character not otherwise in the song are used, please list the character in the description with a link back to them.**
