#Genres

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardstyle):
>Hardstyle is an electronic dance genre mixing influences from techno and hardcore. Hardstyle typically consists of a deep, hard-sounding kick drum, intense faded or reversed basslines accompanying the beat, a dissonant synth melody story telling, and detuned and distorted sounds.
