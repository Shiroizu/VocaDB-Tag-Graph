> The _bakeneko_ (化け猫, "changed cat") is a type of Japanese youkai, or supernatural entity; more specifically, it is a kaibyou, or supernatural cat.
(...) There are tales of cats that became _bakeneko_ after being raised for twelve years in Ibaraki Prefecture and Nagano Prefecture, and for thirteen years in Kunigami District, Okinawa Prefecture. In Yamagata District, Hiroshima Prefecture, it is said that a cat raised for seven years or longer will kill the one that raised it. There are also many regions where, due to this superstition, people decided in advance for how many years they would raise a cat. Depending on the area, there are stories in which cats that were brutally killed by humans would become bakeneko and curse that human. Bakeneko stories are not only about aged cats, but also sometimes about revenge against cruel humans. _(Wikipedia)_
