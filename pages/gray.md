#Themes

An intermediate color between [black](https://vocadb.net/T/8914/black) and [white](https://vocadb.net/T/8913/white).
It is a neutral or achromatic color, meaning literally that it is "without color", because it can be composed of [black](https://vocadb.net/T/8914/black) and [white](https://vocadb.net/T/8913/white).

___

As the middle colour between the two extremes, grey is often used to represent neutrality or conformity.
